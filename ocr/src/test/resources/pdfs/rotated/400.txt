FOREWORD
Electronic design engineers are the true idea men of the electronic
industries. They create ideas and use them in their designs, they stimu-
late ideas in other designers, and they borrow and adapt ideas from
others. One could almost say they feed on and grow on ideas.

ELECTRONIC DESIGN has recognized this need and its edi-
torial content has reflected this awareness. Each issue is literally a col-
lection of useful ideas. In one section, however, special attention has
been devoted to providing a forum for the exchange of ideas between
readers—a section called “Ideas For Design.” Here are presented clever,
unique, ingenious, and often very simple ideas that readers have found
useful, sometimes as parts of larger designs and sometimes as aids in
measuring the parameters or testing the effectiveness of their designs.
Many are quite simple “little” ideas, but experienced designers know
that good little ideas make the good large design possible.

To encourage this exchange of ideas, ELECTRONIC DESIGN
has been sponsoring an IFD Award program. Readers are asked to
vote on the ideas they find most useful in the IFD section of
ELECTRONIC DESIGN. Awards are made to the idea getting the
most votes in an issue, and from the issue winners a grand prize of
$1.000 is awarded for the best “Idea of the Year.”

For the past four years, we have been selecting 100 of the best
ideas and making them available in an annual booklet, arranged by
category for the convenience of readers. Four volumes have appeared
in this series, and now, in response to many requests we have com-
bined these four volumes into a convenient, more durable book. The
ideas have been rearranged under specific categories, making for a very
handy reference book, suitable for a desk or library shelf.

It is diflicult to categorize ideas for designers; they are often
useable in situations not originally considered by the user (or the cate-
gorizer ). Therefore, the reader may not agree with our choice, or worse
still, he may miss a good idea because it did not appear under the cate-
gory to which he felt it belonged. If the former be the case, we wel-
come comments and suggestions for arrangement of future volumes.
To avoid the latter possibility, we suggest at least cursory perusal of
all categories—you may be pleasantly surprised at what you find.
