Spark NLP is a state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing library built on top of Apache Spark. It provides **simple**, **performant** & **accurate** NLP annotations for machine learning pipelines that **scale** easily in a distributed environment.

Spark NLP comes with **83000+** pretrained **pipelines** and **models** in more than **200+** languages.
It also offers tasks such as **Tokenization**, **Word Segmentation**, **Part-of-Speech Tagging**, Word and Sentence **Embeddings**, **Named Entity Recognition**, **Dependency Parsing**, **Spell Checking**, **Text Classification**, **Sentiment Analysis**, **Token Classification**, **Machine Translation** (+180 languages), **Summarization**, **Question Answering**, **Table Question Answering**, **Text Generation**, **Image Classification**, **Image to Text (captioning)**, **Automatic Speech Recognition**, **Zero-Shot Learning**, and many more [NLP tasks](#features).

**Spark NLP** is the only open-source NLP library in **production** that offers state-of-the-art transformers such as **BERT**, **CamemBERT**, **ALBERT**, **ELECTRA**, **XLNet**, **DistilBERT**, **RoBERTa**, **DeBERTa**, **XLM-RoBERTa**, **Longformer**, **ELMO**, **Universal Sentence Encoder**, **Llama-2**, **M2M100**, **BART**, **Instructor**, **E5**, **Google T5**, **MarianMT**, **OpenAI GPT2**, **Vision Transformers (ViT)**, **OpenAI Whisper**, **Llama**, **Mistral**, **Phi**, **Qwen2**, and many more not only to **Python** and **R**, but also to **JVM** ecosystem (**Java**, **Scala**, and **Kotlin**) at **scale** by extending **Apache Spark** natively.

## Model Importing Support

Spark NLP provides easy support for importing models from various popular frameworks:

- **TensorFlow**
- **ONNX**
- **OpenVINO**
- **Llama.cpp (GGUF)**

This wide range of support allows you to seamlessly integrate models from different sources into your Spark NLP workflows, enhancing flexibility and compatibility with existing machine learning ecosystems.

## Quick Start

This is a quick example of how to use Spark NLP pre-trained pipeline in Python and PySpark:

```sh
$ java -version
# should be Java 8 or 11 (Oracle or OpenJDK)
$ conda create -n sparknlp python=3.7 -y
$ conda activate sparknlp
# spark-nlp by default is based on pyspark 3.x
$ pip install spark-nlp==5.5.0 pyspark==3.3.1
```

In Python console or Jupyter `Python3` kernel:

```python
# Import Spark NLP
from sparknlp.base import *
from sparknlp.annotator import *
from sparknlp.pretrained import PretrainedPipeline
import sparknlp

# Start SparkSession with Spark NLP
# start() functions has 3 parameters: gpu, apple_silicon, and memory
# sparknlp.start(gpu=True) will start the session with GPU support
# sparknlp.start(apple_silicon=True) will start the session with macOS M1 & M2 support
# sparknlp.start(memory="16G") to change the default driver memory in SparkSession
spark = sparknlp.start()

# Download a pre-trained pipeline
pipeline = PretrainedPipeline('explain_document_dl', lang='en')

# Your testing dataset
text = """
The Mona Lisa is a 16th century oil painting created by Leonardo.
It's held at the Louvre in Paris.
"""

# Annotate your testing dataset
result = pipeline.annotate(text)

# What's in the pipeline
list(result.keys())
Output: ['entities', 'stem', 'checked', 'lemma', 'document',
         'pos', 'token', 'ner', 'embeddings', 'sentence']

# Check the results
result['entities']
Output: ['Mona Lisa', 'Leonardo', 'Louvre', 'Paris']
```

### Packages Cheatsheet

This is a cheatsheet for corresponding Spark NLP Maven package to Apache Spark / PySpark major version:

| Apache Spark            | Spark NLP on CPU   | Spark NLP on GPU           | Spark NLP on AArch64 (linux)   | Spark NLP on Apple Silicon           |
|-------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 3.0/3.1/3.2/3.3/3.4/3.5 | `spark-nlp`        | `spark-nlp-gpu`            | `spark-nlp-aarch64`            | `spark-nlp-silicon`                  |
| Start Function          | `sparknlp.start()` | `sparknlp.start(gpu=True)` | `sparknlp.start(aarch64=True)` | `sparknlp.start(apple_silicon=True)` |

NOTE: `M1/M2` and `AArch64` are under `experimental` support. Access and support to these architectures are limited by the
community and we had to build most of the dependencies by ourselves to make them compatible. We support these two
architectures, however, they may not work in some environments.

## Pipelines and Models

For a quick example of using pipelines and models take a look at our official [documentation](https://sparknlp.org/docs/en/install#pipelines-and-models)

#### Please check out our Models Hub for the full list of [pre-trained models](https://sparknlp.org/models) with examples, demo, benchmark, and more
