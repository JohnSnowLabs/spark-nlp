Ourexpression studies revealed the presence of the transcript in various humantissues including pancreas, and two major insulin-responsive tissues: fat andskeletal muscle. The characterization of the KCNJ9 gene should facilitate furtherstudies on the function of the KCNJ9 protein and allow evaluation of thepotential role of the locus in Type II diabetes. BACKGROUND: At present, it is one of the most important issues for the treatment of breast cancer to develop the standard therapy for patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes.&quot; val result = pipeline.fullAnnotate(text) Results | | ner_chunk | begin | end | ner_label | confidence | |---:|:------------------------------------------------------------|--------:|------:|:------------|-------------:| | 0 | the G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK | 48 | 106 | TREATMENT | 0.6926 | | 1 | the genomicorganization | 142 | 164 | TREATMENT | 0.80715 | | 2 | a candidate gene forType II diabetes mellitus | 210 | 254 | PROBLEM | 0.754343 | | 3 | byapproximately | 380 | 394 | TREATMENT | 0.7924 | | 4 | single nucleotide polymorphisms | 464 | 494 | TREATMENT | 0.636967 | | 5 | aVal366Ala substitution | 532 | 554 | PROBLEM | 0.53615 | | 6 | an 8 base-pair | 561 | 574 | PROBLEM | 0.607733 | | 7 | insertion/deletion | 581 | 598 | PROBLEM | 0.8692 | | 8 | Ourexpression studies | 601 | 621 | TEST | 0.89975 | | 9 | the transcript in various humantissues | 648 | 685 | PROBLEM | 0.83306 | | 10 | fat andskeletal muscle | 749 | 770 | PROBLEM | 0.778133 | | 11 | furtherstudies | 830 | 843 | PROBLEM | 0.8789 | | 12 | the KCNJ9 protein | 864 | 880 | TREATMENT | 0.561033 | | 13 | evaluation | 892 | 901 | TEST | 0.9981 | | 14 | Type II diabetes | 940 | 955 | PROBLEM | 0.698967 | | 15 | the treatment | 1025 | 1037 | TREATMENT | 0.81195 | | 16 | breast cancer | 1042 | 1054 | PROBLEM | 0.9604 | | 17 | the standard therapy | 1067 | 1086 | TREATMENT | 0.757767 | | 18 | anthracyclines | 1125 | 1138 | TREATMENT | 0.9999 | | 19 | taxanes | 1144 | 1150 | TREATMENT | 0.9999 | Model Information Model Name: ner_clinical_pipeline Type: pipeline Compatibility: Healthcare NLP 4.3.0+ License: Licensed Edition: Official Language: en Size: 1.7 GB Included Models DocumentAssembler SentenceDetectorDLModel TokenizerModel WordEmbeddingsModel MedicalNerModel NerConverterInternalModel</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pipeline to Detect Diagnoses and Procedures (Spanish)</title><link href="/2023/03/15/ner_diag_proc_pipeline_es.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pipeline to Detect Diagnoses and Procedures (Spanish)" /><published>2023-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/2023/03/15/ner_diag_proc_pipeline_es</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/03/15/ner_diag_proc_pipeline_es.html">## Description

text = '''HISTORIA DE ENFERMEDAD ACTUAL: El Sr. Smith es un hombre blanco veterano de 60 años con múltiples comorbilidades, que tiene antecedentes de cáncer de vejiga diagnosticado hace aproximadamente dos años por el Hospital VA. Allí se sometió a una resección. Debía ser ingresado en el Hospital de Día para una cistectomía. Fue visto en la Clínica de Urología y Clínica de Radiología el 02/04/2003. CURSO DE HOSPITAL: El Sr. Smith se presentó en el Hospital de Día antes de la cirugía de Urología. En evaluación, EKG, ecocardiograma fue anormal, se obtuvo una consulta de Cardiología. Luego se procedió a una resonancia magnética de estrés con adenosina cardíaca, la misma fue positiva para isquemia inducible, infarto subendocárdico inferolateral leve a moderado con isquemia peri-infarto. Además, se observa isquemia inducible en el tabique lateral inferior. El Sr. Smith se sometió a un cateterismo del corazón izquierdo, que reveló una enfermedad de las arterias coronarias de dos vasos. La RCA, proximal estaba estenosada en un 95% y la distal en un 80% estenosada. La LAD media estaba estenosada en un 85% y la LAD distal estaba estenosada en un 85%. Se colocaron cuatro stents de metal desnudo Multi-Link Vision para disminuir las cuatro lesiones al 0%. Después de la intervención, el Sr. Smith fue admitido en 7 Ardmore Tower bajo el Servicio de Cardiología bajo la dirección del Dr. Hart. El Sr. Smith tuvo un curso hospitalario post-intervención sin complicaciones. Se mantuvo estable para el alta hospitalaria el 07/02/2003 con instrucciones de tomar Plavix diariamente durante un mes y Urología está al tanto de lo mismo.'''
