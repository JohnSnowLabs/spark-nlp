    Hypercholesterolemia. Continue Lipitor 40 mg a day. Check lipids and ALT today.
    Back pain. No concerning features other than his history of radiation exposure. Given this though, will get an x-ray. Also check CBC, calcium, sed rate and PSA. He was offered a visit to Physical Therapy, but he is not interested in this currently. He will take some acetaminophen as needed.
