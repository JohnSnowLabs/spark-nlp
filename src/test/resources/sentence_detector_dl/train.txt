Slightly more moderate language would make our present situation – namely the lack of progress – a little easier.
Unfortunately the person responsible for this is no longer a minister.
His political successors now have great responsibilities to history and to the heritage of values bequeathed to them by Nelson Mandela.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has generously accepted a number of the ideas put forward by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, which means that we can also support the report's adoption in the form in which it has been presented by the Legal Affairs Committee.
I therefore welcome the opinion of the Committee on Budgets and hope that the EUR 11 785 377 from the Solidarity Fund will be made available to Romania as soon as possible, in order to lift the population economically, environmentally and socially.
In its White Paper, the Commission states that we should promote the railways, that we should start re-using abandoned infrastructure and using lines that are specifically intended for goods transport by rail, and that we should tackle the difficulties at border crossings, as these constitute the pressure points. The Iron Rhine project meets all these conditions, that are listed in the report and in the Commission's White Paper.
People have referred to the salient points: the rights of citizens, investment, controls, transparency, consolidation of the single market, a level playing field, accountability, proper competition and consumer protection.
That would have been an accurate appraisal even six years ago, at the time of the adoption of the Laeken Declaration; it is now more relevant than ever.
However, there are deficiencies too.
We would rather see use of the definition 'commercial advertising', which would allow us to continue to exempt tobacco advertising from freedom of expression without changing the constitution.
The first concerns your reservations on the exclusion from the draft of a detailed reference to specific services, such as the police or the judicial authorities.
As Members know, this agreement marks the renewal of our relations with the Kingdom of Morocco in the fisheries sector after the previous agreement came to an end in November 1999.
During negotiations on this important issue with three rotating presidencies, the goals we wanted to fulfil were as follows:
In the report produced on the White Paper, this Parliament had the opportunity to express its favourable opinion, although with some fine-tuning in certain cases.
It is therefore paragraph 5 with the change I have just mentioned.
We recommend discharge, despite the problems, and at the same time commend the director for the way in which he has managed to keep going.
You have made progress, but there is still some way to go.
We have agreed with the rapporteur in the resolution that we should get some concrete statements from the Commission on both these areas.
Yet the fact remains that for my fishing industry, the common fisheries policy continues to wreak havoc.
For example, several indicators point to the fact that Morocco is seeking to rearm, such as the announcement that it is purchasing American or French fighter planes by investing part of the money obtained under the recent agreement between Vivendi and Maroc Telecom (US $ 3.5 bn).
These are also causing problems in countries that have kept to the timetable.
Even if the Frontex rapid intervention teams work well and efficiently, this will all be in vain if some Member States refuse to face up to their political responsibility.
In the light of the elements that will subsequently be communicated to us, we will have an opportunity to analyse together the advantages and disadvantages of these measures and to take the most appropriate decision.
We have objections, however, to Amendment 31 (Article 13, paragraph 1), since we believe that the scheme of generalised tariff preferences is an instrument for reducing global poverty and is not to be used to protect our European textile industry.
We also want entry into force before the 2009 European elections and for the planned working group to complete its deliberations before the end of 2008.
Mrs Kinnock mentioned the forthcoming meeting in Dakar on basic education.
(GA) Mr President, the condition of the bluefin tuna stock in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean is a source of worry for us all.
Let me give you an example from the past.
The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though this summit provided an important basis.
- supervise the market independently of the pharmaceutical industry;
. (PT) The final agreement on the revision of Directive 76/207/EEC is to be welcomed, although it is inadequate given the initial proposals and the existing problems.
But the people take note of these recantations and will, one day, reject them, or indeed the Western world will come to an end.
And the reality is that, sooner or later, Cyprus will be a united Cyprus, because this unnatural border, this last border of walls and barbed wire, can no longer be sustained.
And yet institutions like the IMF do not have the means to really make themselves heard, and they allow themselves to be pushed into a defensive position from which they continue to lend without any hope of return for fear of even more damaging chaos.
If we can move forward and achieve results at the summit and later in the autumn, then I believe that it will create a very good basis for increased legitimacy and trust in the European institutions.
We have settled quite easily the role that the committees will play in this matter, and there is consensus around that.
Will LEADER retain its identity and independence as a Community initiative with a high level of voluntary Community participation?
In the interests of affirming the plurality of the Union's peoples, does the Commission consider the draft law now under discussion by the Catalan Parliament which would, inter alia, create a framework that would allow Catalan national teams to compete on a similar basis to that already applying to Scottish and Welsh national teams to be in line with the existing criteria for cultural events?
Appointing a coordinator and a performance review body would seem to be a step in the right direction, but at the same time, Commissioner, I fear that this bottom-up approach will not be enough; we have taken it as far as we can and we must now look to take new legislative initiatives.
The powers that the President has are not that much different from the powers enjoyed by President Yeltsin, yet Yeltsin is the person so often to be appeased.
However, where CAP reform is concerned, we ought not to forget other matters too.
I am thinking here of tax collection, of the establishment of administration at local level, of the principle of subsidiarity and of decentralisation.
Although some slight progress was made during the conciliation process on protecting shareholders who do not have control of the company and on adopting some regulations on making the information of workers mandatory, the situation still fails to safeguard all aspects of workers' and minority shareholders' ability to take action.
It is an achievement because we know very well that the situation in our own countries is not easy.
Once again, a European Parliament rapporteur intends to use a straightforward technical exercise to advance the wholly undemocratic goal of a European superstate.
I hope this evening that the Commissioner will agree with me not only that disabled access is a basic right but also that we must insist that in the future at least all European high-speed trains allow easy access for all. It is my contention that we all, as Europeans, will benefit from high-speed trains.
The problem is a total collapse of the social and economic system and of national authority.
We are back at the unemployment rates of 1993.
However, in those ten years the EU has been criticised for failing to put its human rights tools in the field of external relations into practice and it has become increasingly apparent that when dealing with key countries, strategic partnerships and double standards of still eclipse the fundamental human rights which this clause seeks to protect.
The EU aims to define a new policy framework for tourism, with the objective of reinforcing the sector so as to address the great challenges, such as climate change, demographic trends and globalisation, through coordinated action at EU level that complements the Member States' initiatives.
The principle of mutual recognition of judgments should also apply to final judgments, but also to judgments prior to the trial stage itself. A first objective would therefore be to guarantee that capture orders for the purpose of a trial are implemented, bearing in mind the gravity of the crimes we are talking about, in the event that several warrants are served on the same person.
The directive which has just been voted on marks another step towards drafting and applying common regulations and measures required to regulate the situation of immigrants, especially employees from third countries staying illegally in the European Union.
It is unacceptable to extend it to third countries, as in doing so, we would only duplicate the UNESCO World Heritage List.
I should like to think that we can continue to call ourselves Members of the European Parliament.
You cannot say that the Committee on Budgets is applying pressure.
I must tell you that I do not want that at all.
This is the kind of injustice which the Fair Trade movement is dealing with.
We support the proposals in this motion for a resolution which are aimed at promoting solidarity, offsetting or avoiding the adverse effects of economic and monetary union and, above all, combating unemployment: cohesion and unemployment are incompatible.
Mr President, I will not need two minutes.
When, however, the Directorate-General for Competition supports the town of Charleroi’s giving generous subsidies to the airline Ryanair, I believe that it must be criticised because that kind of action distorts competition between towns, between businesses and between modes of transport in a way that is detrimental to the Lisbon and Gothenburg policies.
Like many of my fellow Members, I welcome the resignation of Paul Wolfowitz, a leading neoconservative and one of the main proponents of the war in Iraq.
The first, of course, relates to the code of conduct for Commissioners and a serious approach to the issue of conflicts of interest.
This disease is often called a family disease because of the chronic stress of watching a loved one slowly decline.
I make no apology to anybody for the second principle which I think has to be present and that is the principle of social justice.
I do not really understand why it should discharge itself just now, when the report by the Court of Auditors of the European Communities on monetary and economic issues for 1998 is being prepared and is about to be published.
The fact is that most of the investments that the EU has made will later have positive consequences for Europe as well.
Secondly, social and environmental clauses must be possible, and even enacted at a global level.
Mr President, the Council has always shown a special interest in matters in connection with maintaining a healthy population structure in rural areas.
Because violence is such a massive phenomenon, it has been hard to narrow the Daphne programme down.
There are countries where the media environment is dominated by commercial media, with public service media essentially forming just a kind of background.
This on-going scandal is also affecting the European Union.
The figures from Eurostat show that the transport sector has now overtaken industry as the largest single source of pollution in the EU.
We are in favour of Turkey's accession, if that is the will of its people and provided that it satisfies all the accession criteria.
I believe that we have had enough fireworks and receptions celebrating the enlargement of the European Union.
I should also underline that the Comenius actions of the lifelong learning programme focuses, among other priorities, on increasing motivation in science and mathematics and on improving literacy skills.
I should like to include a few thoughts in my contribution which, I believe, not only deal with a purely technical matter but also offer a basic starting point, in that I think we should take a much more global approach to agricultural policy from the outset.
Indeed I hope many of our efforts in the course of the Presidency have challenged that impression.
These words are of great value in the debate on fixed book prices.
Climate policy offers ample opportunity for innovation and employment.
You can therefore imagine the extent to which we are in fact moving further and further away from it, in some way without any reaction, or moving further and further away from the most basic standards in this respect.
We welcome the adoption of our proposal, which:
Personally, therefore, I believe that this proposal is correct.
   .Mr President, the idea that 2008 should become the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue emerged in connection with the EU’s enlargement to include 10 new Member States, which have added cultural, linguistic and religious diversity to the Community.
The details of the document to be presented in Thessaloniki are as yet unknown, but we assume, as Mr Solana has already indicated, that the strategy is based on a broad interpretation of security.
That is the second thing.
It goes without saying that we shall have to make the changes proposed here if we want to continue to operate the measures that have proved so successful up to now.
As agreed last week by the 27 Member States in the European Council, we will have a proactive agenda for London.
But that precludes me from asking the British and German Members to request their governments to release Roisín McAliskey on humanitarian grounds alone.
I believe that now only small technical or electrical problems occur occasionally but these are dealt with quickly and, I believe, in everyone's best interests.
In our judgment Amendment No 3 on external certification also goes too far.
I really feel that they focused upon what is fundamentally needed.
Where is the sustainability? Where is the value added for Europe?
You will find that a significant number of them will probably make that choice.
If you refuse to understand that, you will, like all members of religious sects, create a rod for your own backs.
However, action to promote innovation and research is a very high priority in the European Union's policy.
We therefore need an extremely strict directive.
That is why this distinction is essential, at least in the register.
Firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Aparicio Sánchez, on the work which he has done on this matter, and I would like to protest at the fact that we have not received the full text of the agreement between the European Union and Switzerland before the section on the distribution of permits, which is only one part of the whole agreement.
In this Union, it is also essential that passengers come first.
This has to be stressed in the European security strategy, and it is being stressed, but we now have to implement it in the right way.
