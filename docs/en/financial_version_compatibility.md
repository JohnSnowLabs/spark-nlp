<div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

Legal NLP runs on top of `johnsnowlabs` library (former *nlu*).

Please find technical documentation about how to install it [here](https://nlu.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/install).

All our models are backwards compatible, which means it will be safe for you to always use the last version of `johnsnowlabs`.

If you are curious about which version of Spark NLP, Visual NLP or Clinical NLP are included in the last `johnsnowlabs` versions, please check [here](https://nlu.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/jsl-release-notes)

Finance NLP is also supported in Annotation Lab from Alab 4.2.3 version on!
