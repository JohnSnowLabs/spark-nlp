### Getting started

We call *Enterprise Spark NLP libraries* to all the commercial NLP libraries, including Healthcare NLP (former
Spark NLP for Healthcare), Finance, Legal NLP, among others. This excludes Visual NLP (former Spark OCR), which has its own documentation page,
available [here](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/ocr).

If you don't have an Enterprise Spark NLP subscription yet, you can ask for a free trial by clicking on the Try Free button and following the instructions provides in the video below.

Enterprise Spark NLP libraries provides healthcare-specific annotators, pipelines, models, and embeddings for:

- Assertion Status Detection
- De-identification
- Relation Extraction
- Spell checking & correction
- and much more!

Note: If you are going to use any pretrained licensed NER model, you don't need to install licensed libray. As long as you have the AWS keys and license keys in your environment, you will be able to use licensed NER models with Spark NLP public library. For the other licensed pretrained models like AssertionDL, Deidentification, Entity Resolvers and Relation Extraction models, you will need to install Spark NLP Enterprise as well.

 The library offers access to several clinical and biomedical transformers: JSL-BERT-Clinical, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, GloVe-Med, GloVe-ICD-O. It also includes over 50 pre-trained healthcare models, that can recognize the following entities (any many more):
- Clinical - support Signs, Symptoms, Treatments, Procedures, Tests, Labs, Sections
- Drugs - support Name, Dosage, Strength, Route, Duration, Frequency
- Risk Factors- support Smoking, Obesity, Diabetes, Hypertension, Substance Abuse
- Anatomy - support Organ, Subdivision, Cell, Structure Organism, Tissue, Gene, Chemical
- Demographics - support Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Race, Ethnicity, Marital Status, Vital Signs
- Sensitive Data- support Patient Name, Address, Phone, Email, Dates, Providers, Identifiers
