When you login to the Annotation Lab, you will be presented with the list of available projects you have created (**My Projects**) or that have been shared with you (**Shared With Me**).

The list of projects can be sorted ascending or descending on the project creation date.

A project can be removed by using the **Delete** option provided in the right side menu. 
You can also import tasks into the project by using the **Import** option, or export available completions by using the **Export** option from the right side menu.

Some basic statistical information are shown for each project:
- The total number of tasks
- The number of completed tasks
- The number of pending tasks
