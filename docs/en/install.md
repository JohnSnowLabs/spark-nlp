## Spark NLP Cheat Sheet

```bash
# Install Spark NLP from PyPI
$pip install spark-nlp==2.4.1

# Install Spark NLP from Anacodna/Conda
conda install -c johnsnowlabs spark-nlp

# Load Spark NLP with Spark Shell
spark-shell --packages com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp_2.11:2.4.1

# Load Spark NLP with PySpark
pyspark --packages com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp_2.11:2.4.1

# Load Spark NLP with Spark Submit
spark-submit --packages com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp_2.11:2.4.1

# Load Spark NLP as external JAR after comiling and bulding Spark NLP by `sbt assembly`
spark-shell --jar spark-nlp-assembly-2.4.1
```

## Python

### Setup Jupyter Notebook

While Jupyter runs code in many programming languages, Python is a
requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the
Jupyter Notebook itself.

### Installing Jupyter using Anaconda

You can install Python and Jupyter using the Anaconda Distribution
which includes Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used
packages for scientific computing and data science.

First, download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads). We
recommend downloading Anaconda’s latest Python 3 version.

Second, install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following
the instructions on the download page.

Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook! To run the
notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or
Command Prompt (Windows):

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Installing Jupyter using pip

As an existing or experienced Python user, you may wish to install
Jupyter using Python’s package manager, pip, instead of Anaconda.

If you have Python 3 installed (which is recommended):

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```

Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook! To run the
notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or
Command Prompt (Windows):

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Install Apache Spark using pyspark

**Pip package**
Be sure that you have the required python library (pyspark 2.4.4)
installed in your python environment by running:

```bash
pip list
```

If not there you can install by using:

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed pyspark==2.4.4
```

**Conda package**
You can also install pyspark 2.4.4 using conda by running in your
terminal:

```bash
conda install pyspark=2.4.4
```

### Install Spark NLP Opensource

**Pip package**
To install Spark NLP Opensource version you can just run:

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed spark-nlp==2.4.1
```

The --ignore-installed parameter is to overwrite your previous pip
package version if already installed.

**Conda package**
If you are using Anaconda/Conda for managing Python packages, you can install Spark NLP Opensource as follow:

```bash
conda install -c johnsnowlabs spark-nlp=2.4.1
```

### Install Licensed Spark NLP

You can also install the licensed package with extra functionalities and
pretrained models by using:

```bash
pip install spark-nlp-jsl==2.4.1 --extra-index-url #### --ignore-installed
```

The #### is a secret url only avaliable for users with license, if you
have not received it please contact us at info@johnsnowlabs.com.

At the moment there is no conda package for Licensed Spark NLP version.

### Setup AWS-CLI Credentials for licensed pretrained models

From Licensed version 2.4.1 in order to access private JohnSnowLabs
models repository you need first to setup your AWS credentials. This
access is done via Amazon aws command line interface (AWSCLI).

Instructions about how to install awscli are available at:

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)

Make sure you configure your credentials with aws configure following
the instructions at:

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)

Please substitute the ACCESS_KEY and SECRET_KEY with the credentials you
have recived. If you need your credentials contact us at
info@johnsnowlabs.com

### Start Spark NLP Session from python

The following will initialize the spark session in case you have run
the jupyter notebook directly. If you have started the notebook using
pyspark this cell is just ignored.

```python
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Spark NLP")\
    .master("local[*]")\
    .config("spark.driver.memory","8G")\
    .config("spark.driver.maxResultSize", "2G") \
    .config("spark.jars.packages", "com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp_2.11:2.4.1")\
    .config("spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max", "500m")\
    .getOrCreate()
```

If using local jars, you can use `spark.jars` instead for a comma
delimited jar files. For cluster setups, of course you'll have to put
the jars in a reachable location for all driver and executor nodes.

### Start Licensed Spark NLP Session from python

The following will initialize the spark session in case you have run
the jupyter notebook directly. If you have started the notebook using
pyspark this cell is just ignored.

Initializing the spark session takes some seconds (usually less than 1
minute) as the jar from the server needs to be loaded.

We will be using version 2.4.1 of Spark NLP Open Source and 2.4.1 of
Spark NLP Enterprise Edition.

The #### in .config("spark.jars", "####") is a secret code, if you have
not received it please contact us at info@johnsnowlabs.com.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Global DEMO - Spark NLP Enterprise 2.4.1") \
    .master("local[*]") \
    .config("spark.driver.memory","4G") \
    .config("spark.driver.maxResultSize", "2G") \
    .config("spark.jars.packages", "com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp_2.11:2.4.1") \
    .config("spark.jars", "####") \
    .getOrCreate()
```
