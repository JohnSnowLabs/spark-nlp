## Spark NLP Cheatsheet

```bash
# Install Spark NLP from PyPI
pip install spark-nlp==4.3.0

# Install Spark NLP from Anacodna/Conda
conda install -c johnsnowlabs spark-nlp

# Load Spark NLP with Spark Shell
spark-shell --packages com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp_2.12:4.3.0

# Load Spark NLP with PySpark
pyspark --packages com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp_2.12:4.3.0

# Load Spark NLP with Spark Submit
spark-submit --packages com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp_2.12:4.3.0

# Load Spark NLP as external JAR after compiling and building Spark NLP by `sbt assembly`
spark-shell --jars spark-nlp-assembly-4.3.0.jar
```

## Python

Spark NLP supports Python 3.6.x and above depending on your major PySpark version.
#### Quick Install

Let's create a new Conda environment to manage all the dependencies there. You can use Python Virtual Environment if you prefer or not have any environment.

```bash
$ java -version
# should be Java 8 (Oracle or OpenJDK)
$ conda create -n sparknlp python=3.8 -y
$ conda activate sparknlp
$ pip install spark-nlp==4.3.0 pyspark==3.2.3
```

Of course you will need to have jupyter installed in your system:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

Now you should be ready to create a jupyter notebook running from terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```


#### Start Spark NLP Session from python

If you need to manually start SparkSession because you have other configurations and `sparknlp.start()` is not including them, you can manually start the SparkSession:

```python
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Spark NLP")\
    .master("local[*]")\
    .config("spark.driver.memory","16G")\
    .config("spark.driver.maxResultSize", "0") \
    .config("spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max", "2000M")\
    .config("spark.jars.packages", "com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp_2.12:4.3.0")\
    .getOrCreate()
```

## Installation for M1 Macs

Starting from version 4.0.0, Spark NLP has experimental support for M1 macs. Note that
at the moment, only the standard variant of the M1 is supported. Other variants (e.g.
M1 Pro/Max/Ultra, M2) will most likely not work.

Make sure the following prerequisites are met:

1. An M1 compiled java version needs to be installed. For example to install the Zulu
    Java 11 JDK head to [Download Azul JDKs](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk) and install that java version.

    To check if the installed java environment is running natively on arm64 and not
    rosetta, you can run the following commands in your shell:

    ```shell
    johnsnow@m1mac ~ % cat $(which java) | file -
    /dev/stdin: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
    ```

    The environment variable `JAVA_HOME` should also be set to this java version. You
    can check this by running `echo $JAVA_HOME` in your terminal. If it is not set,
    you can set it by adding `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)` to your
    `~/.zshrc` file.
2. If you are planning to use Annotators or Pipelines that use the RocksDB library (for
    example `WordEmbeddings`, `TextMatcher` or `explain_document_dl_en` Pipeline
    respectively) with `spark-submit`, then a workaround is required to get it working.
    See [M1 RocksDB workaround for spark-submit with Spark version >= 3.2.0](#m1-rocksdb-workaround-for-spark-submit-with-spark-version--320).

### M1 RocksDB workaround for spark-submit with Spark version >= 3.2.0

Starting from Spark version 3.2.0, Spark includes their own version of the RocksDB
dependency. Unfortunately, this is an older version of RocksDB does not include the
necessary binaries of M1. To work around this issue, the default packaged RocksDB jar
has to be removed from the Spark distribution.

For example, if you downloaded Spark version 3.2.0 from the official archives, you will
find the following folders in the directory of Spark:

```bash
$ ls
bin  conf  data  examples  jars  kubernetes  LICENSE  licenses
NOTICE  python  R  README.md  RELEASE  sbin  yarn
```

To check for the RocksDB jar, you can run

```bash
$ ls jars | grep rocksdb
rocksdbjni-6.20.3.jar
```

to find the jar you have to remove. After removing the jar, the pipelines should work
as expected.

### Scala and Java for M1

Adding Spark NLP to your Scala or Java project is easy:

Simply change to dependency coordinates to `spark-nlp-m1` and add the dependency to your
project.

How to do this is mentioned above: [Scala And Java](#scala-and-java)

So for example for Spark NLP with Apache Spark 3.0.x and 3.1.x you will end up with
maven coordinates like these:

```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.johnsnowlabs.nlp/spark-nlp-m1 -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.johnsnowlabs.nlp</groupId>
    <artifactId>spark-nlp-m1_2.12</artifactId>
    <version>4.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

or in case of sbt:

```scala
// https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.johnsnowlabs.nlp/spark-nlp
libraryDependencies += "com.johnsnowlabs.nlp" %% "spark-nlp-m1" % "4.3.0"
```

If everything went well, you can now start Spark NLP with the `m1` flag set to `true`:

```scala
import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.SparkNLP

val spark = SparkNLP.start(m1 = true)
```

### Python for M1

First, make sure you have a recent Python 3 installation.

```bash
johnsnow@m1mac ~ % python3 --version
Python 3.9.13
```

Then we can install the dependency as described in the [Python section](#python).
It is also recommended to use a virtual environment for this.

If everything went well, you can now start Spark NLP with the `m1` flag set to `True`:

```python
import sparknlp

spark = sparknlp.start(m1=True)
```

## Installation for Linux Aarch64 Systems

Starting from version 4.3.0, Spark NLP supports Linux systems running on an aarch64
processor architecture. The necessary dependencies have been built on Ubuntu 16.04, so a
recent system with an environment of at least that will be needed.

Check the [Python section](#python) and the [Scala And Java section](#scala-and-java) on
to install Spark NLP for your system.

### Starting Spark NLP

Spark NLP needs to be started with the `aarch64` flag set to `true`:

For Scala:

```scala
import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.SparkNLP

val spark = SparkNLP.start(aarch64 = true)
```

For Python:

```python
import sparknlp

spark = sparknlp.start(aarch64=True)
```

## Google Colab Notebook

Google Colab is perhaps the easiest way to get started with spark-nlp. It requires no installation or setup other than having a Google account.

Run the following code in Google Colab notebook and start using spark-nlp right away.

```sh
# This is only to setup PySpark and Spark NLP on Colab
!wget http://setup.johnsnowlabs.com/colab.sh -O - | bash
```

This script comes with the two options to define `pyspark` and `spark-nlp` versions via options:

```sh
# -p is for pyspark
# -s is for spark-nlp
# by default they are set to the latest
!wget http://setup.johnsnowlabs.com/colab.sh -O - | bash /dev/stdin -p 3.2.3 -s 4.3.0
```

[Spark NLP quick start on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/jupyter/quick_start_google_colab.ipynb) is a live demo on Google Colab that performs named entity recognitions and sentiment analysis by using Spark NLP pretrained pipelines.


## Kaggle Kernel

Run the following code in Kaggle Kernel and start using spark-nlp right away.

```sh
# Let's setup Kaggle for Spark NLP and PySpark
!wget http://setup.johnsnowlabs.com/kaggle.sh -O - | bash
```

[Spark NLP quick start on Kaggle Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/mozzie/spark-nlp-named-entity-recognition) is a live demo on Kaggle Kernel that performs named entity recognitions by using Spark NLP pretrained pipeline.

#### Install Spark NLP on Databricks

1. Create a cluster if you don't have one already

2. On a new cluster or existing one you need to add the following to the `Advanced Options -> Spark` tab:

    ```bash
    spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max 2000M
    spark.serializer org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer
    ```

3. In `Libraries` tab inside your cluster you need to follow these steps:

    3.1. Install New -> PyPI -> `spark-nlp` -> Install

    3.2. Install New -> Maven -> Coordinates -> `com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp_2.12:4.3.0` -> Install

4. Now you can attach your notebook to the cluster and use Spark NLP!

NOTE: Databrick's runtimes support different Apache Spark major releases. Please make sure you choose the correct Spark NLP Maven pacakge name (Maven Coordinate) for your runtime from our [Packages Cheatsheet](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp#packages-cheatsheet)

#### Databricks Notebooks

You can view all the Databricks notebooks from this address:

[https://johnsnowlabs.github.io/spark-nlp-workshop/databricks/index.html](https://johnsnowlabs.github.io/spark-nlp-workshop/databricks/index.html)

Note: You can import these notebooks by using their URLs.

## EMR Support

Spark NLP 4.3.0 has been tested and is compatible with the following EMR releases:

- emr-6.2.0
- emr-6.3.0
- emr-6.3.1
- emr-6.4.0
- emr-6.5.0
- emr-6.6.0

Full list of [Amazon EMR 6.x releases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-release-6x.html)

NOTE: The EMR 6.1.0 and 6.1.1 are not supported.

#### How to create EMR cluster via CLI

To lanuch EMR cluster with Apache Spark/PySpark and Spark NLP correctly you need to have bootstrap and software configuration.

A sample of your bootstrap script

```sh
#!/bin/bash
set -x -e

echo -e 'export PYSPARK_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/etc/hadoop/conf
export SPARK_JARS_DIR=/usr/lib/spark/jars
export SPARK_HOME=/usr/lib/spark' >> $HOME/.bashrc && source $HOME/.bashrc

sudo python3 -m pip install awscli boto spark-nlp

set +x
exit 0
```

A sample of your software configuration in JSON on S3 (must be public access):

```json
[{
  "Classification": "spark-env",
  "Configurations": [{
    "Classification": "export",
    "Properties": {
      "PYSPARK_PYTHON": "/usr/bin/python3"
    }
  }]
},
{
  "Classification": "spark-defaults",
    "Properties": {
      "spark.yarn.stagingDir": "hdfs:///tmp",
      "spark.yarn.preserve.staging.files": "true",
      "spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max": "2000M",
      "spark.serializer": "org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer",
      "spark.driver.maxResultSize": "0",
      "spark.jars.packages": "com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp_2.12:4.3.0"
    }
}
]
```

A sample of AWS CLI to launch EMR cluster:

```sh
aws emr create-cluster \
--name "Spark NLP 4.3.0" \
--release-label emr-6.2.0 \
--applications Name=Hadoop Name=Spark Name=Hive \
--instance-type m4.4xlarge \
--instance-count 3 \
--use-default-roles \
--log-uri "s3://<S3_BUCKET>/" \
--bootstrap-actions Path=s3://<S3_BUCKET>/emr-bootstrap.sh,Name=custome \
--configurations "https://<public_access>/sparknlp-config.json" \
--ec2-attributes KeyName=<your_ssh_key>,EmrManagedMasterSecurityGroup=<security_group_with_ssh>,EmrManagedSlaveSecurityGroup=<security_group_with_ssh> \
--profile <aws_profile_credentials>
```

## GCP Dataproc Support

1. Create a cluster if you don't have one already as follows.

At gcloud shell:

```bash
gcloud services enable dataproc.googleapis.com \
  compute.googleapis.com \
  storage-component.googleapis.com \
  bigquery.googleapis.com \
  bigquerystorage.googleapis.com
```

```bash
REGION=<region>
```

```bash
BUCKET_NAME=<bucket_name>
gsutil mb -c standard -l ${REGION} gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
```

```bash
REGION=<region>
ZONE=<zone>
CLUSTER_NAME=<cluster_name>
BUCKET_NAME=<bucket_name>
```

You can set image-version, master-machine-type, worker-machine-type,
master-boot-disk-size, worker-boot-disk-size, num-workers as your needs.
If you use the previous image-version from 2.0, you should also add ANACONDA to optional-components.
And, you should enable gateway.

```bash
gcloud dataproc clusters create ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
  --region=${REGION} \
  --zone=${ZONE} \
  --image-version=2.0 \
  --master-machine-type=n1-standard-4 \
  --worker-machine-type=n1-standard-2 \
  --master-boot-disk-size=128GB \
  --worker-boot-disk-size=128GB \
  --num-workers=2 \
  --bucket=${BUCKET_NAME} \
  --optional-components=JUPYTER \
  --enable-component-gateway \
  --metadata 'PIP_PACKAGES=spark-nlp spark-nlp-display google-cloud-bigquery google-cloud-storage' \
  --initialization-actions gs://goog-dataproc-initialization-actions-${REGION}/python/pip-install.sh
```

2. On an existing one, you need to install spark-nlp and spark-nlp-display packages from PyPI.

3. Now, you can attach your notebook to the cluster and use the Spark NLP!

## Amazon Linux 2 Support

```bash
# Update Package List & Install  Required Packages
sudo yum update
sudo yum install -y amazon-linux-extras
sudo yum -y install python3-pip

# Create Python virtual environment and activate it:
python3 -m venv .sparknlp-env
source .sparknlp-env/bin/activate
```

Check JAVA version:

- For Sparknlp versions above 3.x, please use JAVA-11

Checking Java versions installed on your machine:

```bash
sudo alternatives --config java
```

You can pick the index number (I am using java-8 as default - index 2):

<img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/installation/amazon-linux.png" style="width:100%; align:center; box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);"/>


If you dont have java-11 or java-8 in you system, you can easily install via:

```bash
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
```

Now, we can start installing the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pyspark==3.2.3
pip install spark-nlp
```

## Docker Support

For having Spark NLP, PySpark, Jupyter, and other ML/DL dependencies as a Docker image you can use the following template:

```bash

  }
}
```

## Windows Support

In order to fully take advantage of Spark NLP on Windows (8 or 10), you need to setup/install Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, Java and a Pyton environment correctly by following the following instructions: [https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/discussions/1022](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/discussions/1022)


### How to correctly install Spark NLP on Windows

Follow the below steps to set up Spark NLP with Spark 3.2.3:

  1. Download [Adopt OpenJDK 1.8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot)
     - Make sure it is 64-bit
     - Make sure you install it in the root of your main drive `C:\java`.
     - During installation after changing the path, select setting Path

  2. Download the pre-compiled Hadoop binaries `winutils.exe`, `hadoop.dll` and put it in a folder called `C:\hadoop\bin` from [https://github.com/cdarlint/winutils/tree/master/hadoop-3.2.0/bin](https://github.com/cdarlint/winutils/tree/master/hadoop-3.2.0/bin)
     - **Note:** The version above is for Spark 3.2.3, which was built for Hadoop 3.2.0. You might have to change the hadoop version in the link, depending on which Spark version you are using.

  3. Download [Apache Spark 3.2.3](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/spark/spark-3.2.3/spark-3.2.3-bin-hadoop3.2.tgz) and extract it to `C:\spark`.

  4. Set/add environment variables for `HADOOP_HOME` to `C:\hadoop` and `SPARK_HOME` to `C:\spark`.

  5. Add `%HADOOP_HOME%\bin` and `%SPARK_HOME%\bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.

  6. Install [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributed Package (x64)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999).

  7. Create folders `C:\tmp` and `C:\tmp\hive`
     - If you encounter issues with permissions to these folders, you might need
       to change the permissions by running the following commands:
       ```
       %HADOOP_HOME%\bin\winutils.exe chmod 777 /tmp/hive
       %HADOOP_HOME%\bin\winutils.exe chmod 777 /tmp/
       ```

#### Requisites for PySpark

We recommend using `conda` to manage your Python environment on Windows.

- Download [Miniconda for Python 3.8](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py38_4.11.0-Windows-x86_64.exe)
- See [Quick Install](#quick-install) on how to set up a conda environment with
  Spark NLP.
- The following environment variables need to be set:
  - `PYSPARK_PYTHON=python`
  - Optionally, if you want to use the Jupyter Notebook runtime of Spark:
    - first install it in the environment with `conda install notebook`
    - then set `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=jupyter`, `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS=notebook`
  - The environment variables can either be directly set in windows, or if only
    the conda env will be used, with `conda env config vars set PYSPARK_PYTHON=python`.
    After setting the variable with conda, you need to deactivate and re-activate
    the environment.

Now you can use the downloaded binary by navigating to `%SPARK_HOME%\bin` and
running

Either create a conda env for python 3.6, install *pyspark==3.2.3 spark-nlp numpy* and use Jupyter/python console, or in the same conda env you can go to spark bin for *pyspark --packages com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp_2.12:4.3.0*.

## Offline

Spark NLP library and all the pre-trained models/pipelines can be used entirely offline with no access to the Internet. If you are behind a proxy or a firewall with no access to the Maven repository (to download packages) or/and no access to S3 (to automatically download models and pipelines), you can simply follow the instructions to have Spark NLP without any limitations offline:

- Instead of using the Maven package, you need to load our Fat JAR
- Instead of using PretrainedPipeline for pretrained pipelines or the `.pretrained()` function to download pretrained models, you will need to manually download your pipeline/model from [Models Hub](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/models), extract it, and load it.

Example of `SparkSession` with Fat JAR to have Spark NLP offline:

```python
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Spark NLP")\
    .master("local[*]")\
    .config("spark.driver.memory","16G")\
    .config("spark.driver.maxResultSize", "0") \
    .config("spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max", "2000M")\
    .config("spark.jars", "/tmp/spark-nlp-assembly-4.3.0.jar")\
    .getOrCreate()
```

- You can download provided Fat JARs from each [release notes](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/releases), please pay attention to pick the one that suits your environment depending on the device (CPU/GPU) and Apache Spark version (3.x)
- If you are local, you can load the Fat JAR from your local FileSystem, however, if you are in a cluster setup you need to put the Fat JAR on a distributed FileSystem such as HDFS, DBFS, S3, etc. (i.e., `hdfs:///tmp/spark-nlp-assembly-4.3.0.jar`)

Example of using pretrained Models and Pipelines in offline:

```python
# instead of using pretrained() for online:
# french_pos = PerceptronModel.pretrained("pos_ud_gsd", lang="fr")
# you download this model, extract it, and use .load
french_pos = PerceptronModel.load("/tmp/pos_ud_gsd_fr_2.0.2_2.4_1556531457346/")\
      .setInputCols("document", "token")\
      .setOutputCol("pos")

# example for pipelines
# instead of using PretrainedPipeline
# pipeline = PretrainedPipeline('explain_document_dl', lang='en')
# you download this pipeline, extract it, and use PipelineModel
PipelineModel.load("/tmp/explain_document_dl_en_2.0.2_2.4_1556530585689/")
```

- Since you are downloading and loading models/pipelines manually, this means Spark NLP is not downloading the most recent and compatible models/pipelines for you. Choosing the right model/pipeline is on you
- If you are local, you can load the model/pipeline from your local FileSystem, however, if you are in a cluster setup you need to put the model/pipeline on a distributed FileSystem such as HDFS, DBFS, S3, etc. (i.e., `hdfs:///tmp/explain_document_dl_en_2.0.2_2.4_1556530585689/`)
