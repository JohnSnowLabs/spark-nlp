This section includes benchmarks for different Approach() (training classes), comparing their performance when running in `m5.8xlarge` CPU vs a `Tesla V100 SXM2` GPU, as described in the `Machine Specs` section below.

Different benchmarks, as well as their takeaways and some conclusions of how to get the best of GPU, are included as well, to guide you in the process of getting the best performance out of Spark NLP on GPU.

Each major release comes with big improvements, so please, make sure you use at least that version to fully levearge Spark NLP capabilities on GPU.

### Machine specs

#### CPU
An AWS `m5.8xlarge` machine was used for the CPU benchmarking. This machine consists of `32 vCPUs` and `128 GB of RAM`, as you can check in the official specification webpage available [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/)

#### GPU
A `Tesla V100 SXM2` GPU with `32GB` of memory was used to calculate the GPU benchmarking.

</div>
<div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

### Versions
The benchmarking was carried out with the following Spark NLP versions:

Spark version: `3.0.2`

Hadoop version: `3.2.0`

SparkNLP version: `3.3.4`

Spark nodes: 1

</div>
<div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

### Benchmark on classifierDLApproach()

This experiment consisted of training a Deep Learning Binary Classifier (Question vs Statement classes) at sentence-level, using a fully connected CNN and Bert Sentence Embeddings. Only 1 Spark node was usd for the training.

We used the Spark NLP class `ClassifierDL` and it's method `Approach()` as described in the [documentation](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/annotators#classifierdl).

The pipeline looks as follows:

#### Dataset
The size of the dataset was relatively small (200K), consisting of:

Training (rows): `162250`

Test (rows): `40301`

</div>
<div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

#### Training params
Different batch sizes were tested to demonstrate how GPU performance improves with bigger batches compared to CPU, for a constant number of epochs and learning rate.

Epochs: `10`

Learning rate:  `0.003`

Batch sizes: `32`, `64`, `256`, `1024`

</div>
<div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

#### Results
Even for this average-sized dataset, we can observe that GPU is able to beat the CPU machine by a `76%` in both `training` and `inference` times.

#### Inference times (in minutes)
The average inference time remained more or less constant regardless the batch size:
CPU: `8.7 min`
GPU: `2 min`

#### Performance metrics
A weighted F1-score of 0.88 was achieved, with a 0.90 score for question detection and 0.83 for statements.

### Benchmark on NerDLApproach()

This experiment consisted of training a Name Entity Recognition model (token-level), using our class NerDLApproach(), using Bert Word Embeddings and a Char-CNN-BiLSTM Neural Network. Only 1 Spark node was used for the training.

We used the Spark NLP class `NerDL` and it's method `Approach()` as described in the [documentation](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/annotators#nerdl).

The pipeline looks as follows:

#### Dataset
The size of the dataset was small (17K), consisting of:

Training (rows): `14041`

Test (rows): `3250`

#### Training params
Different batch sizes were tested to demonstrate how GPU performance improves with bigger batches compared to CPU, for a constant number of epochs and learning rate.

</div>
<div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

#### Results
Even for this small dataset, we can observe that GPU is able to beat the CPU machine by a `62%` in `training` time and a `68%` in `inference` times. It's important to mention that the batch size is very relevant when using GPU, since CPU scales much worse with bigger batch sizes than GPU.

### Inference benchmark on BertSentenceEmbeddings()

This experiment consisted of benchmarking the improvement obtained in inference by using GPU on BertSentenceEmbeddings().

We used the Spark NLP class `BertSentenceEmbeddings()` described in the Transformers [documentation](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/transformers#bertsentenceembeddings).

The pipeline contains only two components and looks as follows:

#### Dataset
The size of the dataset was bigger than the previous ones, with `417735` rows for inference.

</div>
<div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

#### Results
We have observed in previous experiments, using BertSentenceEmbeddings (classifierDL) and also BertEmbeddings (NerDL) how GPU improved both training and inference times. In this case, we observe again big improvements in inference, what is already pointing that one of the main reasons of why GPU improves so much over CPU is the better management of Embeddings (word, sentence level) and bigger batch sizes.

Batch sizes: `32`, `64`, `256`, `1024`

### Takeaways: How to get the best of the GPU
You will experiment big GPU improvements in the following cases:

{:.list1}
1. Embeddings and Transformers are used in your pipeline. Take into consideration that GPU will performance very well in Embeddings / Transformer components, but other components of your pipeline may not leverage as well GPU capabilities;
2. Bigger batch sizes get the best of GPU, while CPU does not scale with bigger batch sizes;
3. Bigger dataset sizes get the best of GPU, while may be a bottleneck while running in CPU and lead to performance drops;

</div>
<div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

### MultiGPU training
Right now, we don't support multigpu training (1 model in different GPUs in parallel), but you can train different models in different GPU.
