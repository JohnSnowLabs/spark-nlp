# 1.4.0

Release date: 23-06-2020

#### Overview

Added support Dicom format and improved support image morphological operations.

#### Enhancements

* Updated [start](ocr_install#using-start-function) function. Improved support Spark NLP internal.
* `ImageMorphologyOpening` and `ImageErosion` are removed.
* Improved existing transformers for support de-identification Dicom documents.
* Added possibility to draw filled rectangles to [ImageDrawRegions](ocr_pipeline_components#imagedrawregions).

#### New Features

* Support reading and writing Dicom documents.
* Added [ImageMorphologyOperation](ocr_pipeline_components#imagemorphologyoperation) transformer which support:
 erosion, dilation, opening and closing operations.
 
#### Bugfixes

* Fixed issue in [ImageToText](ocr_pipeline_components#imagetotext) related to extraction coordinates.


# 1.3.0

Release date: 22-05-2020

#### Overview

New functionality for de-identification problem.

#### Enhancements

* Renamed TesseractOCR to ImageToText. 
* Simplified installation.
* Added check license from `SPARK_NLP_LICENSE` env varibale.

#### New Features

* Support storing for binaryFormat. Added support storing Image and PDF files.
* Support selectable pdf for [TextToPdf](ocr_pipeline_components#texttopdf) transformer.
* Added [UpdateTextPosition](ocr_pipeline_components#updatetextposition) transformer.


# 1.2.0

Release date: 08-04-2020


#### Overview

Improved support Databricks and processing selectable pdfs.

#### Enhancements

* Adapted Spark OCR for run on Databricks.
* Added rewriting positions in [ImageToText](ocr_pipeline_components#imagetotext) when run together with PdfToText.
* Added 'positionsCol' param to [ImageToText](ocr_pipeline_components#imagetotext).
* Improved support Spark NLP. Changed [start](/ocr_install#using-start-function) function.

#### New Features

* Added [showImage](ocr_structures#showimages) implicit to Dataframe for display images in Scala Databricks notebooks.
* Added [display_images](ocr_structures#display_images) function for display images in Python Databricks notebooks.
* Added propagation selectable pdf file in [TextToPdf](ocr_pipeline_components#texttopdf). Added 'inputContent' param to 'TextToPdf'.


# 1.1.2

Release date: 09-03-2020

#### Overview

Minor improvements and fixes

#### Enhancements

* Improved messages during license validation

#### Bugfixes

* Fixed dependencies issue


# 1.1.1

#### Overview

Integration with license server.

#### Enhancements

* Added license validation. License can be set in following waysq:
  - Environment variable. Set variable 'JSL_OCR_LICENSE'.

  - Application.conf file. Set property 'jsl.sparkocr.settings.license'.
* Added auto renew license using jsl license server.


# 1.1.0

Release date: 03-03-2020

#### Overview

This release contains improvements for preprocessing image before run OCR and
added possibility to store results to PDF for keep original formatting.


#### New Features

* Added auto calculation maximum size of objects for removing in `ImageRemoveObjects`.
  This improvement avoids to remove `.` and affect symbols with dots (`i`, `!`, `?`).
  Added `minSizeFont` param to `ImageRemoveObjects` transformer for
  activate this functional.
* Added `ocrParams` parameter to `ImageToText` transformer for set any
  ocr params.
* Added extraction font size in `ImageToText`
* Added `TextToPdf` transformer for render text with positions to pdf file.


#### Enhancements

* Added setting resolution in `ImageToText`. And added `ignoreResolution` param with
  default `true` value to `ImageToText` transformer for back compatibility.
* Added parsing resolution from image metadata in `BinaryToImage` transformer.
* Added storing resolution in `PrfToImage` transformer.
* Added resolution field to Image schema.
* Updated 'start' function for set 'PYSPARK_PYTHON' env variable.
* Improve auto-scaling/skew correction:
   - improved access to images values
   - removing unnecessary copies of images
   - adding more test cases
   - improving auto-correlation in auto-scaling.
