This is a ready to use NLP Server for analyzing text documents using NLU library. Over 4500+ industry grade NLP Models in 300+ Languages  are available to use via a simple and intuitive UI, without writing a line of code. For more expert users and more complex tasks, NLP Server also provides a REST API that can be used to process high amounts of data.

The models, refered to as `spells`, are provided by the [NLU library](https://nlu.johnsnowlabs.com/) and
powered by the most widely used NLP library in the industry, [Spark NLP](https://sparknlp.org/).

NLP Server is `free` for everyone to download and use. There is no limitation in the amount of text to analyze.

You can setup NLP-Server as a Docker Machine in any enviroment or get it via the `AWS Marketplace` in just 1 click.

## Web UI
The Web UI is accessible at the following URL: http://localhost:5000/
It allows a very simple and intuitive interaction with the NLP Server.
As a first step the user chooses the spell from the first dropdown. All NLU spells are available.
Then the user has to provide a text document for analysis. This can be done by either copy/pasting text on the text box, or by uploading a csv/json file.
After selecting the grouping option, the user clicks on the `Preview` button to get the results for the first 10 rows of text.

## REST API

NLP Server includes a REST API which can be used to process any amount of data using NLU. Once you deploy the NLP Server, you can access the API documentation at the following URL [http://localhost:5000/docs](http://localhost:5000/docs).

<img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/nlp_server/api_docs.png" style="width:100%; align:center; box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);"/>

## Integrate via the Rest API

Rest APIs are a popular way to integrate different services into one common platform. NLP Server offers its own API to offer a quick programmatic integration with customers' services and applications.
Bellow is a quick overview of the provided endpoints. More details are provided in the API documentation available [http://localhost:5000/docs](http://localhost:5000/docs).

 - Start to analyze
 - Endpoint : /results
 - Method : POST
 - Content-Type (Format) : multipart/form-data
 - Parameters:
   - Spell – the spell that you want to use for this analyze (if you want to run multiple spells you should join them with space character)
   - Data – The data to analyse that can be a single text or an array of strings or files.
   - Grouping – can be choosen from ["document", "sentence", "entity", "word"]. The default value is “” for automatic selection based on spell.
   - Format – The format of the provided input. The default value is "text".
 - Response:
   - uuid – the unique identifier for the analysis process.
 - Check the status of an analysis process
 - Endpoint : /results/{uuid}/status
 - Method : GET
 - Content-Type (Format) : application/json
 - Response:
   - code – the status code that can be one of "progress", "success", "failure", "broken spell", "invalid license", "licensed spell with no license"
   - message – the status message
 - Get the results


After ensuring the status of an analysis is "success" you can get the results:
 - Endpoint : /results/{uuid}
 - Method : GET
 - Content-Type (Format) : application/json
 - Parameters:
   - target – if the specified target is "preview" you only get a small part of results.
 - Response:
   - A JSON object that contains the results generated by the spell (each spell has their own specific keys)

## How to use in Python

```python
import requests
# Invoke Processing with tokenization spell
r = requests.post(f'http://localhost:5000/api/results',json={"spell": "tokenize","data": "I love NLU! <3"})
# Use the uuid to get your processed data
uuid = r.json()['uuid']

# Get status of processing
r = requests.get(f'http://localhost:5000/api/results/{uuid}/status').json
>>> {'status': {'code': 'success', 'message': None}}

# Get results
r = requests.get(f'http://localhost:5000/api/results/{uuid}').json()
>>> {'sentence': {'0': ['I love NLU! <3']}, 'document': {'0': 'I love NLU! <3'}, 'token': {'0': ['I', 'love', 'NLU', '!', '<3']}}

```

## Import a license key

Thanks to the close integration between NLP Server and https://my.JohnSnowLabs.com  website, users can easily select and import one of the available licenses to be used on NLP Server.
The steps to execute for this are:

  1.Click on Login via MYJSL button on the menu bar.

<img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/nlp_server/license/login.png" style="width:100%; align:center; box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);"/>

   2.In the pop-up window click on the Authorize button.

<img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/nlp_server/license/authorize.png" style="width:50%; align:center; box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);"/>

   3.After redirecting back to NLP Server click on the Choose License button.

<img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/nlp_server/license/choose_license.png" style="width:50%; align:center; box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);"/>

   4.In the modal choose the license that you want to use and then click on the Select button.


<img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/nlp_server/license/select.png" style="width:50%; align:center; box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);"/>

   5.After the above steps you will see this success alert on the top right of the page. That confirms the import of license completed successfully.

<img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/nlp_server/license/success.png" style="width:30%; align:center; box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);"/>
