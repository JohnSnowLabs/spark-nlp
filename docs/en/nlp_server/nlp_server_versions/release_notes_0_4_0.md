## 0.4.0

### Highlights

- This version of NLP Server offers support for licensed models and annotators. Users can now upload a Spark NLP for Healthcare license file and get access to a wide range of additional [annotators and transformers](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/licensed_annotators). A valid license key also gives access to more than [400 state-of-the-art healthcare models](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/models?edition=Spark+NLP+for+Healthcare). Those can be used via easy to learn NLU spells or via API calls.
- NLP Server now supports better handling of large amounts of data to quickly analyze via UI by offering support for uploading CSV files.
- Support for floating licenses. Users can now take advantage of the floating license flexibility and use those inside of the NLP Server.
