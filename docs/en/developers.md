Spark NLP is an open-source library and everyone's contribution is welcome!
In this section we provide a guide on how to setup your environment using IntelliJ IDEA for a smoother start. You can also check our video tutorials available on our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/johnsnowlabs 

## Setting up the Environment


<div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

### Import to IntelliJ IDEA

Setup Spark NLP development environment. This section will cover library set up for IntelliJ IDEA.

Before you begin, make sure what you have Java and Spark installed in your system. We suggest that you have installed **jdk 8** and **Apache Spark 2.4.x**. To check installation run:

```shel
java -version
```

![Java version](\assets\images\java_version.png)

and

```shell
spark-submit --version
```

![Spark Submit](\assets\images\spark_submit.png)

Next step is to open IntelliJ IDEA. On the **Welcome to IntelliJ IDEA** screen you will see ability to **Check out from Version Controle**.

![Idea initial screen](\assets\images\idea_init.png)

Log in into your github account in pop up. After select from a list Spark NLP repo url:

```shell
https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp
```

and press *clone* button. If you don't see url in the list, clone or fork repo first to your Github account and try again.

![Idea choose repo](\assets\images\idea_choose_repo.png)

When the repo cloned IDE will detect SBT file with dependencies. Click **Yes** to start import from sbt.

![Pop up build](\assets\images\pop_up_build.png)

In the **Import from sbt** pop up make sure you have JDK 8 detected. Click **Ok** to proceed and download required resources. 

![Pop up settings build](\assets\images\settings_build.png)

If you already had dependences installed you may see the pop up **Not empty folder**, click **Ok** to ignore it and reload resources.

IntelliJ IDEA will be open and it will start syncing SBT project. It make take some time, you will see the progress in the build output panel in the bottom of the screen. To see the project panel in the left press **Alt+1**.

![Idea first screen](\assets\images\idea_first_screen.png)

Next step is to install Python plugin to the IntelliJ IDEA. To do this, open `File -> Settings -> Plugins`, type `Python` in the search and select Python plugin by JetBrains. Install this plugin by clicking `Install` button.

![Python plugin](\assets\images\python_plugin.png)

After this steps you can check project structure in the `File -> Project Structure -> Modules`. 

![Project structure](\assets\images\project_structure.png)

Make sure what you have `spark-nlp` and `spark-nlp-build` folders and no errors in the exported dependencies. 

In the `Project` settings check what project SDK is set to 1.8 and in `Platform Settings -> SDK's` you have Java installation as well as Python installation.

![Project settings](\assets\images\project_settings.png)

![Platform settings](\assets\images\platform_settings.png)

If you don't see Python installed in the `SDK's` tab click **+** button, add **Python SDK** with new virtual environment in the project folder with Python 3.x.

## Compiling, assembly and unit testing

### Run tests in Scala

Click **Add configuration** in the Top right corner. In the pop up click on the **+** and look for **sbt task**. 

![Add config](\assets\images\add_config.png)

In the **Name** field put `Test`. In the **Tasks** field write down `test`. After you can disable checkbox in **Use sbt shell** to have more custom configurations.  In the **VM parameters** increase the memory by changing `-Xmx1024M` to `-Xmx10G` and click **Ok**.

![sbt task](\assets\images\sbt_task.png)

If everything was set up correctly you suhould see unabled green button **Run 'Test'** in the top right. Click on it to start running the tests.

![sbt task](\assets\images\sbt_task_run.png)

This algorithm will Run all tests under ``spark-nlp/src/test/scala/com.johnsnowlabs/``

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

#### Copy tasks

After you created task, click **Edit configuration**. Select target task and instead of **+** button you can click **copy** in the same menu. It will recreate all settings from parent task and create a new task. You can do it for Scala or for Python tasks.

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

#### Run individual tests

Open test file you want to run. For example, ``spark-nlp/src/test/scala/com.johnsnowlabs/nlp/FinisherTestSpec.scala``. Right click on the class name and select **Copy reference**. It will copy to you buffer classpath - ``com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.FinisherTestSpec``. Copy existing Scala task and Name it as ``FinisherTest``.

In the **Tasks** field write down `"testOnly *classpath*"` -> `"testOnly com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.FinisherTestSpec"` and click **Ok** to save individual scala test run configuration.

![individual sbt task](\assets\images\individual_test.png)

Press **play** button to run individual test.

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

### Debugging tests

To run tests in debug mode click **Debug** button (next to **play** button). In this mode task will stop at the given break points.

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

### Run tests in Python

To run Python test, first you need to configure project structure. Go to `File -> Project Settings -> Modules`, click on the **+** button and select **New Module**.

![python module add](\assets\images\python_module_add.png)

In the pop up choose Python on left menu, select Python SDK from created virtual environment and click **Next**.

![python module pop up](\assets\images\python_module_pop_up.png)

Enter `python` in the Module name and click **Finish**.

After you need to add Spark dependencies. Select created Python module and click on the **+** button in the Dependencies part.

![python libs add](\assets\images\python_libs_add.png)

Choose **Jars or directories...** and find the find installation path of spark (usually the folder name is ``spark-2.4.5-bin-hadoop2.7``). In the Spark folder go to the ``python/libs`` and select ``pyspark.zip`` to the project. Do the same for another file in the same folder - ``py4j-0.10.7-src.zip``.

![python libs select](\assets\images\python_libs_select.png)
![python libs attached](\assets\images\python_libs_attached.png)

All available tests are in ``spark-nlp/python/run-tests.py``. Click **Add configuration** or **Edit configuration** in the Top right corner. In the pop up click on the **+** and look for **Python**.

![python test add](\assets\images\python_test_add.png)

In the **Script path** locate file ``spark-nlp/python/run-tests.py``. Also you need to add **SPARK_HOME** environment variable to the project. Choose **Environment variables** and add new variable **SPARK_HOME**. Insert installation path of spark to the Value field.

![python spark home](\assets\images\python_spark_home.png)

![python test config](\assets\images\python_test_config.png)

Click **Ok** to save and close pop up and click **Ok** to confirm new task creation.

Before running the tests we need to install requered python dependencies in the new virtual environment. Select in the bottom menu **Terminal** and activate your environment with command

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

![activate env](\assets\images\activate_env.png)

after install packages by running

```
pip install pyspark numpy
```

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

### Compiling jar


Click **Add configuration** or **Edit configuration** in the Top right corner. In the pop up click on the **+** and select **sbt task**.

In the **Name** field put `AssemblyCopy`. In the **Tasks** field write down `assemblyAndCopy`. After you can disable checkbox in **Use sbt shell** to have more custom configurations.  In the **VM parameters** increase the memory by changing `-Xmx1024M` to `-Xmx6G` and click **Ok**.

![compile jar](\assets\images\compile_jar.png)

You can find created jar in the folder ``spark-nlp/python/lib/sparknlp.jar``

*Note: Assembly command creates a fat jars, that includes all dependencies within* 

</div>

### Compiling pypi, whl

Click **Add configuration** or **Edit configuration** in the Top right corner. In the pop up click on the **+** and select **sbt task**.

In the **Name** field put `AssemblyAndCopyForPyPi`. In the **Tasks** field write down `assemblyAndCopyForPyPi`.

Then you go to ``spark-nlp/python/`` directory and run:

```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

You can find created `whl` and `tar.gz` in the folder ``spark-nlp/python/dist/``. Use this files to install spark-nlp locally:

```
pip install spark_nlp-2.x.x-py3-none-any.whl
```
