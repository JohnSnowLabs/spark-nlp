## The very first: Join our Slack channel

A good idea is to join our channel, to ask for help and share your feedback. Developers and users can help each other here getting started.

[Spark NLP Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/spark-nlp/shared_invite/enQtNjA4MTE2MDI1MDkxLTM4ZDliMjU5OWZmMDE1ZGVkMjg0MWFjMjU3NjY4YThlMTJkNmNjNjM3NTMwYzlhMWY4MGMzODI2NDBkOWU4ZDE){:.button.button--info.button--rounded.button--md}

## The very second: Spark NLP Workshop

If you are of those who prefer learning by example, check this repository!

[Spark NLP Workshop](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop){:.button.button--primary.button--rounded.button--md}

It is full of fresh examples and even a docker container if you want to skip installation.

Below, you can follow into a more theoretical and thorough quick start guide.

## Requirements & Setup

Spark NLP is built on top of **Apache Spark 2.4.0** and such is the **only** supported release. it is recommended to have basic knowledge of the framework and a working environment before using Spark NLP. However, we try our best to make it easy for you to get started. Refer to Spark [documentation](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.0/index.html) to get started with Spark.

To start using the library, execute any of the following lines depending on your desired use case:

```bash
spark-shell --packages JohnSnowLabs:spark-nlp:2.0.8
pyspark --packages JohnSnowLabs:spark-nlp:2.0.8
spark-submit --packages JohnSnowLabs:spark-nlp:2.0.8
```

### **Straight forward Python on jupyter notebook**

Use pip to install (after you pip installed numpy and pyspark)

```bash
pip install spark-nlp==2.0.8
jupyter notebook
```

The easiest way to get started, is to run the following code:

```python
import sparknlp
sparknlp.start()
```

With those lines of code, you have successfully started a Spark Session and are ready to use Spark NLP

If you need more fine tuning, you will have to start SparkSession in your python program manually, this is an example

```python
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .master('local[4]') \
    .appName('OCR Eval') \
    .config("spark.driver.memory", "6g") \
    .config("spark.executor.memory", "6g") \
    .config("spark.jars.packages", "JohnSnowLabs:spark-nlp:2.0.8") \
    .getOrCreate()
```

### Databricks cloud cluster & Apache Zeppelin

Add the following maven coordinates in the dependency configuration page:

```bash
com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp_2.11:2.0.8
```

For Python in **Apache Zeppelin** you may need to setup _**SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTIONS**_ utilizing --packages instruction shown above like this

```bash
export SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTIONS="--packages JohnSnowLabs:spark-nlp:2.0.8"
```

### **Python Jupyter Notebook with PySpark**

```python
export SPARK_HOME=/path/to/your/spark/folder
export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=jupyter
export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS=notebook

pyspark --packages JohnSnowLabs:spark-nlp:2.0.8
```

### S3 based standalone cluster (No Hadoop)

If your distributed storage is S3 and you don't have a standard hadoop configuration (i.e. fs.defaultFS) You need to specify where in the cluster distributed storage you want to store Spark NLP's tmp files. First, decide where you want to put your **application.conf** file

```bash
import com.johnsnowlabs.util.ConfigLoader
ConfigLoader.setConfigPath("/somewhere/to/put/application.conf")
```

And then we need to put in such application.conf the following content

```json
sparknlp {
    settings {
        cluster_tmp_dir = "somewhere in s3n:// path to some folder"
    }
}
```

For further alternatives and documentation check out our README page in [GitHub](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp).

## Concepts

Spark ML provides a set of Machine Learning applications, and it's logic consists of two main components: **Estimators** and **Transformers**. The first, have a method called fit() which secures and trains a piece of data to such application, and a **Transformer**, which is generally the result of a fitting process, applies changes to the the target dataset. These components have been embedded to be applicable to Spark NLP. **Pipelines** are a mechanism that allow multiple estimators and transformers within a single workflow, allowing multiple chained transformations along a Machine Learning task. Refer to [Spar kML](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/ml-guide.html) library for more information.

## Annotation

An annotation is the basic form of the result of a Spark NLP operation. It's structure is made of:

- **annotatorType:** which annotator generated this annotation
- **begin:** the begin of the matched content relative to raw-text
- **end:** the end of the matched content relative to raw-text
- **result:** the main output of the annotation
- **metadata:** content of matched result and additional information
- **embeddings:** (new in 2.0) contains vector mappings if required

This object is **automatically generated** by annotators after a transform process. No manual work is required. But it must be understood in order to use it efficiently.

## Annotators

Annotators are the spearhead of NLP functions in Spark NLP. There are two forms of annotators:

- **Annotator Approaches:** Are those who represent a Spark ML Estimator and require a training stage. They have a function called fit(data) which trains a model based on some data. They produce the second type of annotator which is an annotator model or transformer.
- **Annotator Model:** They are spark models or transformers, meaning they have a **transform(data)** function which take a dataset and add to it a column with the result of this annotation. All transformers are additive, meaning they append to current data, never replace or delete previous information.

Both forms of annotators can be included in a Pipeline and will automatically go through all stages in the provided order and transform the data accordingly. A Pipeline is turned into a PipelineModel after the fit() stage. Either before or after can be saved and re-loaded to disk at any time.

### Common Functions

- **setInputCols**(column_names): Takes a list of column names of annotations required by this annotator
- **setOutputCol(**column_name): Defines the name of the column containing the result of this annotator. Use this name as an input for other annotators requiring the annotations of this one.

## Quickly annotate some text

### Explain Document ML

Spark NLP offers a variety of pretrained pipelines that will help you get started, and get a sense of how the library works. We are constantly working on improving the available content.

### Downloading and using a pretrained pipeline

Explain Document ML, named as explain_document_ml is a pretrained pipeline that does a little bit of everything NLP related. Let's try it out in scala (note that the first time might take longer since it downloads the model from our servers!)

```scala
import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.pretrained.PretrainedPipeline

val annotations = PretrainedPipeline("explain_document_ml").annotate("We are very happy about SparkNLP")

annotations("lemmas")
annotations("pos")

scala> annotations("lemmas")
res8: Seq[String] = List(We, be, very, happy, about, SparkNLP)

scala> annotations("pos")
res9: Seq[String] = ArrayBuffer(PRP, VBP, RB, JJ, IN, NNP)
```

### Using a pretrained pipeline with spark dataframes

```scala
val data = Seq("hello, this is an example sentence").toDF("text")

val annotations = PretrainedPipeline("explain_document_ml").transform(data)
annotations.show()

+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
|                text|            document|            sentence|               token|               spell|              lemmas|               stems|                 pos|
+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
|hello, this is an...|[[document, 0, 33...|[[document, 0, 33...|[[token, 0, 4, he...|[[token, 0, 4, he...|[[token, 0, 4, he...|[[token, 0, 4, he...|[[pos, 0, 4, UH, ...|
+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
```

### Manipulating pipelines

To add a bit of challenge, the output of the previous DataFrame was in terms of Annotation objects. What if we want to deal with just the resulting annotations? We can use the Finisher annotator, retrieve the Explain Document ML pipeline, and add them together in a Spark ML Pipeline. Note that pretrained pipelines expect the target column to be named "text".

```scala
import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.Finisher
import org.apache.spark.ml.Pipeline

val finisher = new Finisher().
    setInputCols("token", "lemmas", "pos")

val explainPipeline = PretrainedPipeline("explain_document_ml").model

val pipeline = new Pipeline().
    setStages(Array(
        explainPipeline,
        finisher
    ))

pipeline.
    fit(data).
    transform(data).
    show(truncate=false)

+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+----------------------------+
|text                              |finished_token                             |finished_lemmas                            |finished_pos                |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+----------------------------+
|hello, this is an example sentence|[hello, ,, this, is, an, example, sentence]|[hello, ,, this, be, an, example, sentence]|[UH, ,, DT, VBZ, DT, NN, NN]|
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+----------------------------+
```

## Setup your own pipeline

### Annotator types

Every annotator has a type. Those annotators that share a type, can be used interchangeably, meaning you could you use any of them when needed. For example, when a token type annotator is required by another annotator, such as a sentiment analysis annotator, you can either provide a normalized token or a lemma, as both are of type token.

### Necessary imports

Since version 1.5.0 we are making necessary imports easy to reach, **base.\_** will include general Spark NLP transformers and concepts, while **annotator.\_** will include all annotators that we currently provide. We also need Spark ML pipelines.

```scala
import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.base._
import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.annotator._
import org.apache.spark.ml.Pipeline
```

### DocumentAssembler: Getting data in

In order to get through the NLP process, we need to get raw data annotated. There is a special **transformer** that does this for us: the **DocumentAssembler**, it creates the first annotation of type **Document** which may be used by annotators down the road

```scala
val documentAssembler = new DocumentAssembler().
    setInputCol("text").
    setOutputCol("document")
```

### Sentence detection and tokenization

In this quick example, we now proceed to identify the sentences in each of our document lines. SentenceDetector requires a Document annotation, which is provided by the DocumentAssembler output, and it's itself a Document type token. The Tokenizer requires a Document annotation type, meaning it works both with DocumentAssembler or SentenceDetector output, in here, we use the sentence output.

```scala
val sentenceDetector = new SentenceDetector().
    setInputCols(Array("document")).
    setOutputCol("sentence")

val regexTokenizer = new Tokenizer().
    setInputCols(Array("sentence")).
    setOutputCol("token")
```

## Using Spark ML Pipeline

Now we want to put all this together and retrieve the results, we use a Pipeline for this. We also include another special transformer, called **Finisher** to show tokens in a human language. We use an emptyDataFrame in fit() since none of the pipeline stages have a training stage.

```scala
val testData = Seq("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, " +
    "consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor " +
    "incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.").toDF("text")

val finisher = new Finisher().
    setInputCols("token").
    setCleanAnnotations(false)

val pipeline = new Pipeline().
    setStages(Array(
        documentAssembler,
        sentenceDetector,
        regexTokenizer,
        finisher
    ))

pipeline.
    fit(Seq.empty[String].toDF("text")).
    transform(Seq("hello, this is an example sentence").toDF("text")).
    show()
```

## Using Spark NLP's LightPipeline

LightPipeline is a Spark NLP specific Pipeline class equivalent to Spark ML Pipeline. The difference is that it's execution does not hold to Spark principles, instead it computes everything locally (but in parallel) in order to achieve fast results when dealing with small amounts of data. This means, we do not input a Spark Dataframe, but a string or an Array of strings instead, to be annotated. To create Light Pipelines, you need to input an already trained (fit) Spark ML Pipeline. It's transform() stage is converted into annotate() instead.

```scala
import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.base._

val trainedModel = pipeline.fit(Seq.empty[String].toDF("text"))

val lightPipeline = new LightPipeline(trainedModel)

lightPipeline.annotate("Hello world, please annotate my text")
```

## Utilizing Spark NLP OCR Module

Spark NLP OCR Module is not included within Spark NLP. It is not an annotator and not an extension to Spark ML. You can include it with the following coordinates for Maven:

```bash
com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp-ocr_2.11:2.0.8
```

### Creating Spark datasets from PDF (To be used with Spark NLP)

You can use OcrHelper to directly create spark dataframes from PDF. This will hold entire documents in single rows, meant to be later processed by a SentenceDetector. This way, you won't be breaking the content in rows as if you were reading a standard document. Metadata column will include page numbers and file name information per row.

```scala
import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.util.io.OcrHelper

val myOcrHelper = new OcrHelper

val data = myOcrHelper.createDataset(spark, "/pdfs/")

val documentAssembler = new DocumentAssembler().setInputCol("text").setMetadataCol("metadata")

documentAssembler.transform(data).show()
```

### Creating an Array of Strings from PDF (For LightPipeline)

Another way, would be to simply create an array of strings. This is useful for example if you are parsing a small amount of pdf files and would like to use LightPipelines instead. See an example below.

```scala
import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.util.io.OcrHelper

val myOcrHelper = new OcrHelper

val raw = myOcrHelper.createMap("/pdfs/")

val documentAssembler = new DocumentAssembler().setInputCol("text").setOutputCol("document")

val sentenceDetector = new SentenceDetector().setInputCols("document").setOutputCol("sentence")

val lightPipeline = new LightPipeline(new Pipeline().setStages(Array(documentAssembler, sentenceDetector)).fit(Seq.empty[String].toDF("text")))

pipeline.annotate(raw.values.toArray)
```

## Training annotators

### Training methodology

Training your own annotators is the most key concept when dealing with real life scenarios. Any of the annotators provided above, such as pretrained pipelines and models, will rarely ever apply to a specific use case. Dealing with real life problems will require training your own models. In Spark NLP, training annotators will vary depending on the annotators. Currently, we support three ways:

1. Most annotators are capable of training through the dataset passed to **fit()** just as Spark ML does. Annotators that use the suffix **Approach** are trainable annotators. Training from fit() is the standard behavior in Spark ML. Annotators have different schema requirements for training. Check the reference to see what are the requirements of each annotators.

2. Training from an **external source**: Some of our annotators train from an external file or folder passed to the annotator as a param. You will see such ones as **setCorpus()** or **setDictionary()** param setter methods, allowing you to configure the input to use. You can set Spark NLP to read them as Spark datasets or LINE_BY_LINE which is usually faster for small files

3. Last but not least, some of our annotators are **Deep Learning** based. These models may be trained with the standard AnnotatorApproach API just like any other annotator. For more advanced users, we also allow importing your own graphs or even training from Python and converting them into an AnnotatorModel.
