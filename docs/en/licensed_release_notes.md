### 2.7.6

We are glad to announce that Spark NLP for Healthcare 2.7.6 has been released!

#### Highlights:

- New pretrained **Radiology Assertion Status** model to assign `Confirmed`, `Suspected`, `Negative` assertion scopes to imaging findings or any clinical tests.

- **Obfuscating** the same sensitive information (patient or doctor name) with the same fake names across the same clinical note.

- Version compatibility checker for the pretrained clinical models and builds to keep up with the latest development efforts in production.

- Adding more English names to faker module in **Deidentification**.

- Updated & improved clinical **SentenceDetectorDL** model.

- New upgrades on `ner_deid_large` and `ner_deid_enriched` NER models to cover more use cases with better resolutions.

- Adding more [examples](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/tree/master/scala/healthcare) to workshop repo for _Scala_ users to practice more on healthcare annotators. 

- Bug fixes & general improvements.

#### 1. Radiology Assertion Status Model

We trained a new assertion model to assign `Confirmed`, `Suspected`, `Negative` assertion scopes to imaging findings or any clinical tests. It will try to assign these statuses to any named entity you would feed to the assertion annotater in the same pipeline.

     radiology_assertion = AssertionDLModel.pretrained("assertion_dl_radiology", "en", "clinical/models")\
     .setInputCols(["sentence", "ner_chunk", "embeddings"])\
     .setOutputCol("assertion")

`text = Blunting of the left costophrenic angle on the lateral view posteriorly suggests a small left pleural effusion. No right-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax is definitively seen. There are mildly displaced fractures of the left lateral 8th and likely 9th ribs.`


|sentences |chunk | ner_label |sent_id|assertion|
|-----------:|:-----:|:---------:|:------:|:------|
|Blunting of the left costophrenic angle on the lateral view posteriorly suggests a small left pleural effusion.|Blunting           |ImagingFindings|0      |Confirmed|
|Blunting of the left costophrenic angle on the lateral view posteriorly suggests a small left pleural effusion.|effusion           |ImagingFindings|0      |Suspected|
|No right-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax is definitively seen.                                          |effusion           |ImagingFindings|1      |Negative |
|No right-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax is definitively seen.                                          |pneumothorax       |ImagingFindings|1      |Negative |
|There are mildly displaced fractures of the left lateral 8th and likely 9th ribs.                              |displaced fractures|ImagingFindings|2      |Confirmed|

You can also use this with `AssertionFilterer` to return clinical findings from a note only when it is i.e. `confirmed` or `suspected`.

     assertion_filterer = AssertionFilterer()\
     .setInputCols("sentence","ner_chunk","assertion")\
     .setOutputCol("assertion_filtered")\
     .setWhiteList(["confirmed","suspected"])

     >> ["displaced fractures", "effusion"]

#### 2. **Obfuscating** with the same fake name across the same note:

     obfuscation = DeIdentification()\
      .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "ner_chunk"]) \
      .setOutputCol("deidentified") \
      .setMode("obfuscate")\
      .setObfuscateDate(True)\
      .setSameEntityThreshold(0.8)\
      .setObfuscateRefSource("faker")

      
    text =''' Provider: David Hale, M.D.
              Pt: Jessica Parker 
              David told  Jessica that she will need to visit the clinic next month.'''



|    | sentence                                                               | obfuscated                                                          |
|---:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0 | Provider: `David Hale`, M.D.                                             | Provider: `Dennis Perez`, M.D.                                          |
|  1 | Pt: `Jessica Parker`                                                     | Pt: `Gerth Bayer`                                                       |
|  2 | `David` told  `Jessica` that she will need to visit the clinic next month. | `Dennis` told  `Gerth` that she will need to visit the clinic next month. |

#### 3. Library Version Compatibility Table :

#### 4. Pretrained Models Version Control :

Due to active release cycle, we are adding & training new pretrained models at each release and it might be tricky to maintain the backward compatibility or keep up with the latest models, especially for the users using our models locally in air-gapped networks. 

We are releasing a new utility class to help you check your local & existing models with the latest version of everything we have up to date. This is an highly experimental feature of which we plan to improve and add more capability later on.


    from sparknlp_jsl.check_compatibility import Compatibility

     checker = sparknlp_jsl.Compatibility()

     result = checker.find_version(aws_access_key_id=license_keys['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],

### 2.7.5

We are glad to announce that Spark NLP for Healthcare 2.7.5 has been released!  

#### Highlights:

- New pretrained **Relation Extraction** model to link clinical tests to test results and dates to clinical entities: `re_test_result_date`
- Adding two new `Admission` and `Discharge` entities to `ner_events_clinical` and renaming it to `ner_events_admission_clinical`
- Improving `ner_deid_enriched` NER model to cover `Doctor` and `Patient` name entities in various context and notations.
- Bug fixes & general improvements.

#### 1. re_test_result_date :

text = "Hospitalized with pneumonia in June, confirmed by a positive PCR of any specimen, evidenced by SPO2 </= 93% or PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mmHg"

|    | Chunk-1   | Entity-1   | Chunk-2   | Entity-2    | Relation     |
|---:|:----------|:-----------|:----------|:------------|:-------------|
|  0 | pneumonia | Problem    | june      | Date        | is_date_of   |
|  1 | PCR       | Test       | positive  | Test_Result | is_result_of |

### 2.7.4

We are glad to announce that Spark NLP for Healthcare 2.7.4 has been released!  

#### Highlights:

- Introducing a new annotator to extract chunks with NER tags using regex-like patterns: **NerChunker**.
- Introducing two new annotators to filter chunks: **ChunkFilterer** and **AssertionFilterer**.
- Ability to change the entity type in **NerConverterInternal** without using ChunkMerger (`setReplaceDict`).
- In **DeIdentification** model, ability to use `faker` and static look-up lists at the same time randomly in `Obfuscation` mode.
- New **De-Identification NER** model, augmented with synthetic datasets to detect uppercased name entities.
- Bug fixes & general improvements.

#### 1. NerChunker:

Similar to what we used to do in **POSChunker** with POS tags, now we can also extract phrases that fits into a known pattern using the NER tags. **NerChunker** would be quite handy to extract entity groups with neighboring tokens when there is no pretrained NER model to address certain issues. Lets say we want to extract clinical findings and body parts together as a single chunk even if there are some unwanted tokens between. 

**How to use:**

    ner_model = NerDLModel.pretrained("ner_radiology", "en", "clinical/models")\
        .setInputCols("sentence","token","embeddings")\
        .setOutputCol("ner")
                
    ner_chunker = NerChunker().\
        .setInputCols(["sentence","ner"])\
        .setOutputCol("ner_chunk")\
        .setRegexParsers(["<IMAGINGFINDINGS>*<BODYPART>"])

    text = 'She has cystic cyst on her kidney.'

    >> ner tags: [(cystic, B-IMAGINGFINDINGS), (cyst,I-IMAGINGFINDINGS), (kidney, B-BODYPART)
    >> ner_chunk: ['cystic cyst on her kidney']


#### 2. ChunkFilterer:

**ChunkFilterer** will allow you to filter out named entities by some conditions or predefined look-up lists, so that you can feed these entities to other annotators like Assertion Status or Entity Resolvers.  It can be used with two criteria: **isin** and **regex**.

**How to use:**

    ner_model = NerDLModel.pretrained("ner_clinical", "en", "clinical/models")\
          .setInputCols("sentence","token","embeddings")\
          .setOutputCol("ner")

    ner_converter = NerConverter() \
          .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "ner"]) \
          .setOutputCol("ner_chunk")
          
    chunk_filterer = ChunkFilterer()\
          .setInputCols("sentence","ner_chunk")\
          .setOutputCol("chunk_filtered")\
          .setCriteria("isin") \ 
          .setWhiteList(['severe fever','sore throat'])

    text = 'Patient with severe fever, sore throat, stomach pain, and a headache.'

    >> ner_chunk: ['severe fever','sore throat','stomach pain','headache']
    >> chunk_filtered: ['severe fever','sore throat']


#### 3. AssertionFilterer:

**AssertionFilterer** will allow you to filter out the named entities by the list of acceptable assertion statuses. This annotator would be quite handy if you want to set a white list for the acceptable assertion statuses like `present` or `conditional`; and do not want `absent` conditions get out of your pipeline.

**How to use:**

    clinical_assertion = AssertionDLModel.pretrained("assertion_dl", "en", "clinical/models") \
      .setInputCols(["sentence", "ner_chunk", "embeddings"]) \
      .setOutputCol("assertion")
    
    assertion_filterer = AssertionFilterer()\
      .setInputCols("sentence","ner_chunk","assertion")\
      .setOutputCol("assertion_filtered")\
      .setWhiteList(["present"])


    text = 'Patient with severe fever and sore throat, but no stomach pain.'

    >> ner_chunk: ['severe fever','sore throat','stomach pain','headache']
    >> assertion_filtered: ['severe fever','sore throat']

 
### 2.7.3

We are glad to announce that Spark NLP for Healthcare 2.7.3 has been released!  

#### Highlights:

- Introducing a brand-new **RelationExtractionDL Annotator** – Achieving SOTA results in clinical relation extraction using **BioBert**.
- Massive Improvements & feature enhancements in **De-Identification** module:
    - Introduction of **faker** augmentation in Spark NLP for Healthcare to generate random data for obfuscation in de-identification module.
    - Brand-new annotator for **Structured De-Identification**.
- **Drug Normalizer:**  Normalize medication-related phrases (dosage, form and strength) and abbreviations in text and named entities extracted by NER models.
- **Confidence scores** in **assertion** output : just like NER output, assertion models now also support confidence scores for each prediction.
- **Cosine similarity** metrics in entity resolvers to get more informative and semantically correct results.
- **AuxLabel** in the metadata of entity resolvers to return additional mappings.
- New **Relation Extraction** models to extract relations between **body parts** and clinical entities.
- New **Entity Resolver** models to extract billable medical codes.
- New **Clinical Pretrained NER** models.
- Bug fixes & general improvements.
- Matching the version with Spark NLP open-source v2.7.3.


#### 1. Improvements in De-Identification Module:

Integration of `faker` library to automatically generate random data like names, dates, addresses etc so users dont have to specify dummy data (custom obfuscation files can still be used). It also improves the obfuscation results due to a bigger pool of random values.

**How to use:**

Set the flag `setObfuscateRefSource` to `faker`

    deidentification = DeIdentification()
        .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "ner_chunk"])\
		.setOutputCol("deidentified")\
		.setMode("obfuscate") \
		.setObfuscateRefSource("faker")

For more details: Check out this [notebook ](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Healthcare/4.Clinical_DeIdentification.ipynb)

#### 2. Structured De-Identification Module:

Introduction of a new annotator to handle de-identification of structured data. it  allows users to define a mapping of columns and their obfuscation policy. Users can also provide dummy data and map them to columns they want to replace values in.

**How to use:**

	obfuscator = StructuredDeidentification \
		(spark,{"NAME":"PATIENT","AGE":"AGE"},
		obfuscateRefSource = "faker")

	obfuscator_df = obfuscator.obfuscateColumns(df)

	obfuscator_df.select("NAME","AGE").show(truncate=False)

**Example:**

Input Data:

Name  | Age
------------- | -------------
Cecilia Chapman|83
Iris Watson    |9  
Bryar Pitts    |98
Theodore Lowe  |16
Calista Wise   |76

Deidentified:

Name  | Age
------------- | -------------
Menne Erdôs|20
 Longin Robinson     |31  
 Flynn Fiedlerová   |50
 John Wakeland  |21
Vanessa Andersson   |12


For more details: Check out this [notebook](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Healthcare/4.Clinical_DeIdentification.ipynb).

#### 3. Introducing SOTA relation extraction model using BioBert

A brand-new end-to-end trained BERT model, resulting in massive improvements. Another new annotator (`ReChunkFilter`) is also developed for this new model to allow syntactic features work well with BioBert to extract relations.

**How to use:**

    re_ner_chunk_filter = RENerChunksFilter()\
        .setInputCols(["ner_chunks", "dependencies"])\
        .setOutputCol("re_ner_chunks")\
        .setRelationPairs(pairs)\
        .setMaxSyntacticDistance(4)

    re_model = RelationExtractionDLModel()\
        .pretrained(“redl_temporal_events_biobert”, "en", "clinical/models")\
        .setPredictionThreshold(0.9)\
        .setInputCols(["re_ner_chunks", "sentences"])\
        .setOutputCol("relations")


##### Benchmarks:

For more details: Check out the [notebook](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Healthcare/10.1.Clinical_Relation_Extraction_BodyParts_Models.ipynb) or [modelshub](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/models?tag=relation_extraction).



#### 4. Drug Normalizer:

Standardize units of drugs and handle abbreviations in raw text or drug chunks identified by any NER model. This normalization significantly improves performance of entity resolvers.  

**How to use:**

    drug_normalizer = DrugNormalizer()\
        .setInputCols("document")\
        .setOutputCol("document_normalized")\
        .setPolicy("all") #all/abbreviations/dosages

**Examples:**

`drug_normalizer.transform("adalimumab 54.5 + 43.2 gm”)`

    >>> "adalimumab 97700 mg"

**Changes:** _combine_ `54.5` + `43.2` and _normalize_ `gm` to `mg`

`drug_normalizer.transform("Agnogenic one half cup”)`

    >>> "Agnogenic 0.5 oral solution"

**Changes:** _replace_ `one half` to the `0.5`, _normalize_ `cup` to the `oral solution`

`drug_normalizer.transform("interferon alfa-2b 10 million unit ( 1 ml ) injec”)`

    >>> "interferon alfa - 2b 10000000 unt ( 1 ml ) injection "

**Changes:** _convert_ `10 million unit` to the `10000000 unt`, _replace_ `injec` with `injection`

For more details: Check out this [notebook](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Healthcare/23.Drug_Normalizer.ipynb)

#### 5. Assertion models to support confidence in output:

Just like NER output, assertion models now also provides _confidence scores_ for each prediction.

chunks  | entities | assertion | confidence
-----------|-----------|------------|-------------
a headache | PROBLEM | present |0.9992
anxious | PROBLEM | conditional |0.9039
alopecia | PROBLEM | absent |0.9992
pain | PROBLEM | absent |0.9238

`.setClasses()` method is deprecated in `AssertionDLApproach`  and users do not need to specify number of classes while training, as it will be inferred from the dataset.


#### 6. New Relation Extraction Models:


We are also releasing new relation extraction models to link the clinical entities to body parts and dates. These models are trained using binary relation extraction approach for better accuracy.

**- re_bodypart_direction :**  Relation Extraction between `Body Part` and `Direction` entities.

**Example:**

**Text:** _“MRI demonstrated infarction in the upper brain stem , left cerebellum and right basil ganglia”_

relations | entity1                     | chunk1     | entity2                     | chunk2        | confidence
-----------|-----------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|---------------|------------
1         | Direction                   | upper      | bodyPart | brain stem    | 0.999
0         | Direction                   | upper      | bodyPart | cerebellum    | 0.999
0         | Direction                   | upper      | bodyPart | basil ganglia | 0.999
0         | bodyPart | brain stem | Direction                   | left          | 0.999
0         | bodyPart | brain stem | Direction                   | right         | 0.999
1         | Direction                   | left       | bodyPart | cerebellum    | 1.0         
0         | Direction                   | left       | bodyPart | basil ganglia | 0.976
0         | bodyPart | cerebellum | Direction                   | right         | 0.953
1         | Direction                   | right      | bodyPart | basil ganglia | 1.0       


**- re_bodypart_problem :** Relation Extraction between `Body Part` and `Problem` entities.

**Example:**

**Text:** _“No neurologic deficits other than some numbness in his left hand.”_

relation | entity1   | chunk1              | entity2                      | chunk2   | confidence  
--|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------|-----------  
0 | Symptom   | neurologic deficits | bodyPart | hand     |          1
1 | Symptom   | numbness            | bodyPart | hand     |          1


**- re_bodypart_proceduretest :**  Relation Extraction between `Body Part` and `Procedure`, `Test` entities.

**Example:**

**Text:** _“TECHNIQUE IN DETAIL: After informed consent was obtained from the patient and his mother, the chest was scanned with portable ultrasound.”_

relation | entity1                      | chunk1   | entity2   | chunk2              | confidence  
---------|-----------------------------|---------|----------|--------------------|-----------
1 | bodyPart | chest    | Test      | portable ultrasound |    0.999

**-re_date_clinical :** Relation Extraction between `Date` and different clinical entities.   

**Example:**

**Text:** _“This 73 y/o patient had CT on 1/12/95, with progressive memory and cognitive decline since 8/11/94.”_

relations | entity1 | chunk1                                   | entity2 | chunk2  | confidence
-----------|---------|------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|
1         | Test    | CT                                       | Date    | 1/12/95 | 1.0
1         | Symptom | progressive memory and cognitive decline | Date    | 8/11/94 | 1.0


**How to use:**

    re_model = RelationExtractionModel()\
        .pretrained("re_bodypart_direction","en","clinical/models")\
        .setInputCols(["embeddings", "pos_tags", "ner_chunks", "dependencies"])\
        .setOutputCol("relations")\
        .setMaxSyntacticDistance(4)\
        .setRelationPairs([‘Internal_organ_or_component’, ‘Direction’])



For more details: Check out the [notebook](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Healthcare/10.1.Clinical_Relation_Extraction_BodyParts_Models.ipynb) or [modelshub](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/models?tag=relation_extraction).


**New matching scheme for entity resolvers - improved accuracy:** Adding the option to use `cosine similarity` to resolve entities and find closest matches, resulting in better, more semantically correct results.

#### 7. New Resolver Models using `JSL SBERT`:

+ `sbiobertresolve_icd10cm_augmented`

+ `sbiobertresolve_cpt_augmented`

+ `sbiobertresolve_cpt_procedures_augmented`

+ `sbiobertresolve_icd10cm_augmented_billable_hcc`

+ `sbiobertresolve_hcc_augmented`


**Returning auxilary columns mapped to resolutions:**  Chunk entity resolver and sentence entity resolver now returns auxilary data that is mapped the resolutions during training. This will allow users to get multiple resolutions with single model without using any other annotator in the pipeline (In order to get billable codes otherwise there needs to be other modules in the same pipeline)

**Example:**

`sbiobertresolve_icd10cm_augmented_billable_hcc`
**Input Text:** _"bladder cancer"_

idx | chunks | code | resolutions | all_codes | billable | hcc_status | hcc_score | all_distances   
---|---------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
 0 | bladder cancer | C679 | ['bladder cancer', 'suspected bladder cancer', 'cancer in situ of urinary bladder', 'tumor of bladder neck', 'malignant tumour of bladder neck'] | ['C679', 'Z126', 'D090', 'D494', 'C7911'] | ['1', '1', '1', '1', '1'] | ['1', '0', '0', '0', '1'] | ['11', '0', '0', '0', '8'] | ['0.0000', '0.0904', '0.0978', '0.1080', '0.1281'] |

`sbiobertresolve_cpt_augmented`  
**Input Text:** _"ct abdomen without contrast"_

idx|  cpt code |   distance |resolutions

2 | 70450 |     0.1323 | Computed tomography, head or brain; without contrast material      |
3 | 74176 |     0.1333 | Computed tomography, abdomen and pelvis; without contrast material |

5 | 77059 |     0.1343 | Magnetic resonance imaging without contrast                        |

#### 8. New Pretrained Clinical NER Models

+ NER Radiology
**Input Text:** _"Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder. This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow. This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma."_

### 2.7.2

We are glad to announce that Spark NLP for Healthcare 2.7.2 has been released !

In this release, we introduce the following features:

+ Far better accuracy for resolving medication terms to RxNorm codes:

  `ondansetron 8 mg tablet' -> '312086`
+ Far better accuracy for resolving diagnosis terms to ICD-10-CM codes:

 `TIA -> transient ischemic attack (disorder)	‘S0690’`
+ New ability to map medications to pharmacological actions (PA):

  `'metformin' -> ‘Hypoglycemic Agents’ `
+ 2 new *greedy* named entity recognition models for medication details:

 `ner_drugs_greedy: ‘magnesium hydroxide 100mg/1ml PO’`

 ` ner_posology _greedy: ‘12 units of insulin lispro’ `

+ New model to *classify the gender* of a patient in a given medical note:

 `'58yo patient with a family history of breast cancer' -> ‘female’ `
+ And starting customized spark sessions with rich parameters

```python
        params = {"spark.driver.memory":"32G",
        "spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max":"2000M",
        "spark.driver.maxResultSize":"2000M"}

        spark = sparknlp_jsl.start(secret, params=params)
```
State-of-the-art accuracy is achieved using new healthcare-tuned BERT Sentence Embeddings (s-Bert). The following sections include more details, metrics, and examples.

#### Named Entity Recognizers for Medications


+ A new medication NER (`ner_drugs_greedy`) that joins the drug entities with neighboring entities such as  `dosage`, `route`, `form` and `strength`; and returns a single entity `drug`.  This greedy NER model would be highly useful if you want to extract a drug with its context and then use it to get a RxNorm code (drugs may get different RxNorm codes based on the dosage and strength information).

###### Metrics

| label  | tp    | fp   | fn   | prec  | rec   | f1    |
|--------|-------|------|------|-------|-------|-------|
| I-DRUG | 37423 | 4179 | 3773 | 0.899 | 0.908 | 0.904 |
| B-DRUG | 29699 | 2090 | 1983 | 0.934 | 0.937 | 0.936 |


+ A new medication NER (`ner_posology_greedy`) that joins the drug entities with neighboring entities such as  `dosage`, `route`, `form` and `strength`.  It also returns all the other medication entities even if not related to (or joined with) a drug.   

Now we have five different medication-related NER models. You can see the outputs from each model below:

Text = ''*The patient was prescribed 1 capsule of Advil 10 mg for 5 days and magnesium hydroxide 100mg/1ml suspension PO. He was seen by the endocrinology service and she was discharged on 40 units of insulin glargine at night, 12 units of insulin lispro with meals, and metformin 1000 mg two times a day.*''

#### Patient Gender Classification

This model detects the gender of the patient in the clinical document. It can classify the documents into `Female`, `Male` and `Unknown`.

We release two models:

+ 'Classifierdl_gender_sbert' (more accurate, works with licensed `sbiobert_base_cased_mli`)

+ 'Classifierdl_gender_biobert' (works with `biobert_pubmed_base_cased`)

The models are trained on more than four thousands clinical documents (radiology reports, pathology reports, clinical visits etc.), annotated internally.

###### Metrics `(Classifierdl_gender_sbert)`

|        | precision | recall | f1-score | support |
| ------ | --------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| Female | 0.9224    | 0.8954 | 0.9087   | 239     |
| Male   | 0.7895    | 0.8468 | 0.8171   | 124     |

Text= ''*social history: shows that  does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol, lives in a nursing home.
family history: shows a family history of breast cancer.*''

```python
gender_classifier.annotate(text)['class'][0]
>> `Female`
```

#### New ICD10CM and RxCUI resolvers powered by s-Bert embeddings

The advent of s-Bert sentence embeddings changed the landscape of Clinical Entity Resolvers completely in Spark NLP. Since s-Bert is already tuned on [MedNLI](https://physionet.org/content/mednli/) (medical natural language inference) dataset, it is now capable of populating the chunk embeddings in a more precise way than before.

We now release two new resolvers:

+ `sbiobertresolve_icd10cm_augmented` (augmented with synonyms, four times richer than previous resolver accuracy:

    `73% for top-1 (exact match), 89% for top-5 (previous accuracy was 59% and 64% respectively)`

+ `sbiobertresolve_rxcui` (extract RxNorm concept unique identifiers to map with ATC or durg families)
accuracy:

    `71% for top-1 (exact match), 72% for top-5
(previous accuracy was 22% and 41% respectively)`

a. **ICD10CM augmented resolver**

### 2.7.1

We are glad to announce that Spark NLP for Healthcare 2.7.1 has been released !

In this release, we introduce the following features:

#### 1. Sentence BioBert and Bluebert Transformers that are fine tuned on [MedNLI](https://physionet.org/content/mednli/) dataset.

Sentence Transformers offers a framework that provides an easy method to compute dense vector representations for sentences and paragraphs (also known as sentence embeddings). The models are based on BioBert and BlueBert, and are tuned specifically to meaningful sentence embeddings such that sentences with similar meanings are close in vector space. These are the first PyTorch based models we managed to port into Spark NLP.

Here is how you can load these:
```python
sbiobert_embeddins = BertSentenceEmbeddings\
     .pretrained("sbiobert_base_cased_mli",'en','clinical/models')\
     .setInputCols(["ner_chunk_doc"])\
     .setOutputCol("sbert_embeddings")
```
```python
sbluebert_embeddins = BertSentenceEmbeddings\
     .pretrained("sbluebert_base_cased_mli",'en','clinical/models')\
     .setInputCols(["ner_chunk_doc"])\
     .setOutputCol("sbert_embeddings")
```

#### 2. SentenceEntityResolvers powered by s-Bert embeddings.

The advent of s-Bert sentence embeddings changed the landscape of Clinical Entity Resolvers completely in Spark NLP. Since s-Bert is already tuned on MedNLI (medical natural language inference) dataset, it is now capable of populating the chunk embeddings in a more precise way than before.

Using sbiobert_base_cased_mli, we trained the following Clinical Entity Resolvers:

sbiobertresolve_icd10cm  
sbiobertresolve_icd10pcs  
sbiobertresolve_snomed_findings (with clinical_findings concepts from CT version)  
sbiobertresolve_snomed_findings_int  (with clinical_findings concepts from INT version)  
sbiobertresolve_snomed_auxConcepts (with Morph Abnormality, Procedure, Substance, Physical Object, Body Structure concepts from CT version)  
sbiobertresolve_snomed_auxConcepts_int  (with Morph Abnormality, Procedure, Substance, Physical Object, Body Structure concepts from INT version)  
sbiobertresolve_rxnorm  
sbiobertresolve_icdo  
sbiobertresolve_cpt  

Code sample:

(after getting the chunk from ChunkConverter)

```python
c2doc = Chunk2Doc().setInputCols("ner_chunk").setOutputCol("ner_chunk_doc")
sbert_embedder = BertSentenceEmbeddings\
     .pretrained("sbiobert_base_cased_mli",'en','clinical/models')\
     .setInputCols(["ner_chunk_doc"])\
     .setOutputCol("sbert_embeddings")

snomed_ct_resolver = SentenceEntityResolverModel
 .pretrained("sbiobertresolve_snomed_findings","en", "clinical/models") \
 .setInputCols(["ner_chunk", "sbert_embeddings"]) \
 .setOutputCol("snomed_ct_code")\
 .setDistanceFunction("EUCLIDEAN")
 ```

Output:

|    | chunks                      |   begin |   end |      code | resolutions
|  2 | COPD  				 |     113 |   116 |  13645005 | copd - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
|  8 | PTCA                        |     324 |   327 | 373108000 | post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (finding)

#### 3. We are releasing the following pretrained clinical NER models:

ner_drugs_large   
(trained with medications dataset, and extracts drugs with the dosage, strength, form and route at once as a single entity; entities: drug)  
ner_deid_sd_large  
(extracts PHI entities, trained with augmented dataset)  
ner_anatomy_coarse  
(trained with enriched anatomy NER dataset; entities: anatomy)  
ner_anatomy_coarse_biobert  
chunkresolve_ICD10GM_2021 (German ICD10GM resolver)


We are also releasing two new NER models:

ner_aspect_based_sentiment  
(extracts positive, negative and neutral aspects about restaurants from the written feedback given by reviewers. )  
ner_financial_contract  
(extract financial entities from contracts. See the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Healthcare/19.Financial_Contract_NER.ipynb) for details.)  


### 2.7.0

We are glad to announce that Spark NLP for Healthcare 2.7 has been released !

In this release, we introduce the following features:

#### 1. Text2SQL

Text2SQL Annotator that translates natural language text into SQL queries against a predefined database schema, which is one of the
most sought-after features of NLU. With the help of a pretrained text2SQL model, you will be able to query your database without writing a SQL query:

Example 1

Query:
What is the name of the nurse who has the most appointments?

Generated
SQL query from the model:

```sql
SELECT T1.Name  
FROM Nurse AS T1  
JOIN Appointment AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.PrepNurse  
GROUP BY T2.prepnurse  
ORDER BY count(*) DESC  
LIMIT 1  
```

Response:  

|    | Name           |
|---:|:---------------|
|  0 | Carla Espinosa |

Example 2

Query:
How many patients do each physician take care of? List their names and number of patients they take care of.

Generated
SQL query from the model:

```sql
SELECT T1.Name,  
count(*)  
FROM Physician AS T1  
JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.PCP  
GROUP BY T1.Name  
```

Response:   

|    | Name             |   count(*) |
|---:|:-----------------|-----------:|
|  0 | Christopher Turk |          1 |
|  1 | Elliot Reid      |          2 |
|  2 | John Dorian      |          1 |


For now, it only comes with one pretrained model (trained on Spider
dataset) and new pretrained models will be released soon.

Check out the
Colab notebook to  see more examples and run on your data.


#### 2. SentenceEntityResolvers

In addition to ChunkEntityResolvers, we now release our first BioBert-based entity resolvers using the SentenceEntityResolver
annotator. It’s
fully trainable and comes with several pretrained entity resolvers for the following medical terminologies:

CPT: `biobertresolve_cpt`  
ICDO: `biobertresolve_icdo`  
ICD10CM: `biobertresolve_icd10cm`  
ICD10PCS: `biobertresolve_icd10pcs`  
LOINC: `biobertresolve_loinc`  
SNOMED_CT (findings): `biobertresolve_snomed_findings`  
SNOMED_INT (clinical_findings): `biobertresolve_snomed_findings_int`    
RXNORM (branded and clinical drugs): `biobertresolve_rxnorm_bdcd`  

Example:
```python
text = 'He has a starvation ketosis but nothing significant for dry oral mucosa'
df = get_icd10_codes (light_pipeline_icd10, 'icd10cm_code', text)
```

|    | chunks               |   begin |   end | code |
|---:|:---------------------|--------:|------:|:-------|
|  0 | a starvation ketosis |       7 |    26 | E71121 |                                                                                                                                                   
|  1 | dry oral mucosa      |      66 |    80 | K136   |


Check out the Colab notebook to  see more examples and run on your data.

You can also train your own entity resolver using any medical terminology like MedRa and UMLS. Check this notebook to
learn more about training from scratch.


#### 3. ChunkMerge Annotator

In order to use multiple NER models in the same pipeline, Spark NLP Healthcare has ChunkMerge Annotator that is used to return entities from each NER
model by overlapping. Now it has a new parameter to avoid merging overlapping entities (setMergeOverlapping)
to return all the entities regardless of char indices. It will be quite useful to analyze what every NER module returns on the same text.


#### 4. Starting SparkSession


We now support starting SparkSession with a different version of the open source jar and not only the one it was built
against by `sparknlp_jsl.start(secret, public="x.x.x")` for extreme cases.


#### 5. Biomedical NERs

We are releasing 3 new biomedical NER models trained with clinical embeddings (all one single entity models)  

`ner_bacterial_species` (comprising of Linneaus and Species800 datasets)  
`ner_chemicals` (general purpose and bio chemicals, comprising of BC4Chem and BN5CDR-Chem)  
`ner_diseases_large` (comprising of ner_disease, NCBI_Disease and BN5CDR-Disease)  

We are also releasing the biobert versions of the several clinical NER models stated below:  
`ner_clinical_biobert`  
`ner_anatomy_biobert`  
`ner_bionlp_biobert`

In addition to these, we release two new German NER models:

`ner_healthcare_slim` ('TIME_INFORMATION', 'MEDICAL_CONDITION',  'BODY_PART',  'TREATMENT', 'PERSON', 'BODY_PART')  
`ner_traffic` (extract entities regarding traffic accidents e.g. date, trigger, location etc.)  

#### 6. PICO Classifier

Successful evidence-based medicine (EBM) applications rely on answering clinical questions by analyzing large medical literature databases. In order to formulate
a well-defined, focused clinical question, a framework called PICO is widely used, which identifies the sentences in a given medical text that belong to the four components: Participants/Problem (P)  (e.g., diabetic patients), Intervention (I) (e.g., insulin),
Comparison (C) (e.g., placebo)  and Outcome (O) (e.g., blood glucose levels).

Spark NLP now introduces a pretrained PICO Classifier that
is trained with Biobert embeddings.

Example:

```python
text = “There appears to be no difference in smoking cessation effectiveness between 1mg and 0.5mg varenicline.”
pico_lp_pipeline.annotate(text)['class'][0]

ans: CONCLUSIONS
```

### 2.6.2

#### Overview
We are very happy to announce that version 2.6.2 of Spark NLP Enterprise is ready to be installed and used.
We are making available Named Entity Recognition, Sentence Classification and Entity Resolution models to analyze Adverse Drug Events in natural language text from clinical domains.

#### Models

##### NERs
We are pleased to announce that we have a brand new named entity recognition (NER) model for Adverse Drug Events (ADE) to extract ADE and DRUG entities from a given text.

ADE NER will have four versions in the library, trained with different size of word embeddings:

`ner_ade_bioert` (768d Bert embeddings)  
`ner_ade_clinicalbert` (768d Bert embeddings)  
`ner_ade_clinical` (200d clinical embeddings)  
`ner_ade_healthcare` (100d healthcare embeddings)  

More information and examples [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Healthcare/16.Adverse_Drug_Event_ADE_NER_and_Classifier.ipynb)

We are also releasing our first clinical pretrained classifier for ADE classification tasks. This new ADE classifier is trained on various ADE datasets, including the mentions in tweets to represent the daily life conversations as well. So it works well on the texts coming from academic context, social media and clinical notes. It’s trained with `Clinical Biobert` embeddings, which is the most powerful contextual language model in the clinical domain out there.

##### Classifiers
ADE classifier will have two versions in the library, trained with different Bert embeddings:

`classifierdl_ade_bioert` (768d BioBert embeddings)  
`classifierdl_adee_clinicalbert` (768d ClinicalBert embeddings)  

More information and examples [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Healthcare/16.Adverse_Drug_Event_ADE_NER_and_Classifier.ipynb)

##### Pipeline
By combining ADE NER and Classifier, we are releasing a new pretrained clinical pipeline for ADE tasks to save you from building pipelines from scratch. Pretrained pipelines are already fitted using certain annotators and transformers according to various use cases and you can use them as easy as follows:
```python
pipeline = PretrainedPipeline('explain_clinical_doc_ade', 'en', 'clinical/models')

pipeline.annotate('my string')
```
`explain_clinical_doc_ade` is bundled with `ner_ade_clinicalBert`, and `classifierdl_ade_clinicalBert`. It can extract ADE and DRUG clinical entities, and then assign ADE status to a text (`True` means ADE, `False` means not related to ADE).

More information and examples [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Healthcare/11.Pretrained_Clinical_Pipelines.ipynb)


##### Entity Resolver
We are releasing the first Entity Resolver for `Athena` (Automated Terminology Harmonization, Extraction and Normalization for Analytics, http://athena.ohdsi.org/) to extract concept ids via standardized medical vocabularies. For now, it only supports `conditions` section and can be used to map the clinical conditions with the corresponding standard terminology and then get the concept ids to store them in various database schemas.
It is named as `chunkresolve_athena_conditions_healthcare`.

We added slim versions of several clinical NER models that are trained with 100d healthcare word embeddings, which is lighter and smaller in size.

`ner_healthcare`
`assertion_dl_healthcare`
`ner_posology_healthcare`
`ner_events_healthcare`

##### Graph Builder
Spark NLP Licensed version has several DL based annotators (modules) such as NerDL, AssertionDL, RelationExtraction and GenericClassifier, and they are all based on Tensorflow (tf) with custom graphs. In order to make the creating and customizing the tf graphs for these models easier for our licensed users, we added a graph builder to the Python side of the library. Now you can customize your graphs and use them in the respected models while training a new DL model.

```python
from sparknlp_jsl.training import tf_graph

tf_graph.build("relation_extraction",build_params={"input_dim": 6000, "output_dim": 3, 'batch_norm':1, "hidden_layers": [300, 200], "hidden_act": "relu", 'hidden_act_l2':1}, model_location=".", model_filename="re_with_BN")
```

### 2.5.2

#### Overview

We are really happy to bring you Spark NLP for Healthcare 2.5.2, with a couple new features and several enhancements in our existing annotators.
This release was mainly dedicated to generate adoption in our AnnotationToolJsonReader, a connector that provide out-of-the-box support for out Annotation Tool and our practices.
Also the ChunkMerge annotator has ben provided with extra functionality to remove entire entity types and to modify some chunk's entity type
We also dedicated some time in finalizing some refactorization in DeIdentification annotator, mainly improving type consistency and case insensitive entity dictionary for obfuscation.
Thanks to the community for all the feedback and suggestions, it's really comfortable to navigate together towards common functional goals that keep us agile in the SotA.

### 2.5.0

#### Overview

We are happy to bring you Spark NLP for Healthcare 2.5.0 with new Annotators, Models and Data Readers.
Model composition and iteration is now faster with readers and annotators designed for real world tasks.
We introduce ChunkMerge annotator to combine all CHUNKS extracted by different Entity Extraction Annotators.
We also introduce an Annotation Reader for JSL AI Platform's Annotation Tool.
This release is also the first one to support the models: `ner_large_clinical`, `ner_events_clinical`, `assertion_dl_large`, `chunkresolve_loinc_clinical`, `deidentify_large`
And of course we have fixed some bugs.

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

#### New Features

* AnnotationToolJsonReader is a new class that imports a JSON from AI Platform's Annotation Tool an generates NER and Assertion training datasets
* ChunkMerge Annotator is a new functionality that merges two columns of CHUNKs handling overlaps with a very straightforward logic: max coverage, max # entities
* ChunkMerge Annotator handles inputs from NerDLModel, RegexMatcher, ContextualParser, TextMatcher
* A DeIdentification pretrained model can now work in 'mask' or 'obfuscate' mode

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

### 2.4.5

#### Overview

We are glad to announce Spark NLP for Healthcare 2.4.5. As a new feature we are happy to introduce our new EnsembleEntityResolver which allows our Entity Resolution architecture to scale up in multiple orders of magnitude and handle datasets of millions of records on a sub-log computation increase
We also enhanced our ChunkEntityResolverModel with 5 new distance calculations with weighting-array and aggregation-strategy params that results in more levers to finetune its performance against a given dataset.

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

#### New Features

* EnsembleEntityResolver consisting of an integrated TFIDF-Logreg classifier in the first layer + Multiple ChunkEntityResolvers in the second layer (one per each class)
* Five (5) new distances calculations for ChunkEntityResolver, namely:
    - Token Based: TFIDF-Cosine, Jaccard, SorensenDice
    - Character Based: JaroWinkler and Levenshtein

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

### 2.4.1

#### Overview

Introducing Spark NLP for Healthcare 2.4.1 after all the feedback we received in the form of issues and suggestions on our different communication channels.
Even though 2.4.0 was very stable, version 2.4.1 is here to address minor bug fixes that we summarize in the following lines.

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

#### Bugfixes

* Changing the license Spark property key to be "jsl" instead of "sparkjsl" as the latter generates inconsistencies
* Fix the alignment logic for tokens and chunks in the ChunkEntityResolverSelector because when tokens and chunks did not have the same begin-end indexes the resolution was not executed

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

### 2.4.0

#### Overview

We are glad to announce Spark NLP for Healthcare 2.4.0. This is an important release because of several refactorizations achieved in the core library, plus the introduction of several state of the art algorithms, new features and enhancements.
We have included several architecture and performance improvements, that aim towards making the library more robust in terms of storage handling for Big Data.
In the NLP aspect, we have introduced a ContextualParser, DocumentLogRegClassifier and a ChunkEntityResolverSelector.
These last two Annotators also target performance time and memory consumption by lowering the order of computation and data loaded to memory in each step when designed following a hierarchical pattern.
We have put a big effort on this one, so please enjoy and share your comments. Your words are always welcome through all our different channels.
Thank you very much for your important doubts, bug reports and feedback; they are always welcome and much appreciated.

#### New Features

* BigChunkEntityResolver Annotator: New experimental approach to reduce memory consumption at expense of disk IO.
* ContextualParser Annotator: New entity parser that works based on context parameters defined in a JSON file.
* ChunkEntityResolverSelector Annotator: New AnnotatorModel that takes advantage of the RecursivePipelineModel + LazyAnnotator pattern to annotate with different LazyAnnotators at runtime.
* DocumentLogregClassifier Annotator: New Annotator that provides a wrapped TFIDF Vectorizer + LogReg Classifier for TOKEN AnnotatorTypes (either at Document level or Chunk level)

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

#### Enhancements

* `normalizedColumn` Param is no longer required in ChunkEntityResolver Annotator (defaults to the `labelCol` Param value).
* ChunkEntityResolverMetadata now has more data to infer whether the match is meaningful or not.

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

#### Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug on ContextSpellChecker Annotator where unrecognized tokens would cause an exception if not in vocabulary.
* Fixed a bug on ChunkEntityResolver Annotator where undetermined results were coming out of negligible confidence scores for matches.
* Fixed a bug on ChunkEntityResolver Annotator where search would fail if the `neighbours` Param was grater than the number of nodes in the tree. Now it returns up to the number of nodes in the tree.
