## Text Classification

Text classification is the process of automatically categorizing text into predefined labels or categories based on its content.

## Token Classification

Token classification is the process of assigning labels to individual tokens (words or subwords) in a text, commonly used for tasks like named entity recognition or part-of-speech tagging.

## Zero-Shot Classification

Zero-shot classification is the process of categorizing text into labels without the model having seen any examples of those labels during training, using general knowledge and context.

## Question Answering

Question answering models can retrieve answers from a given text, making them useful for searching documents. Some models can even generate answers independently, without needing any context!

## Summarization

Summarization models condense long texts into shorter versions, capturing the main ideas and key points while maintaining the overall meaning of the original content.

## Text Preprocessing

Text Preprocessing is the task of cleaning and transforming raw text into a format suitable for NLP tasks. This includes steps like tokenization, lowercasing, removing stop words, and stemming or lemmatization to prepare text for analysis.

## Dependency Parsing

Dependency Parsing is a syntactic analysis method that examines the grammatical structure of a sentence by identifying the dependencies between its words. It illustrates how words relate to each other through a dependency tree or graph, where some words act as "parents" and others as "children."
