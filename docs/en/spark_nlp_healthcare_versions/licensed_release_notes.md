#### The First Voice of Patients (VOP) Named Entity Recognition Model

We are releasing a new VOP NER model that was trained on the conversations gathered from patients forums.


| model name                                     | description                                                                                         | predicted entities                     |

| [ner_vop_slim_wip](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/2023/03/02/ner_vop_slim_wip_en.html) | This model extracts healthcare-related terms from the documents transferred from the patient's own sentences. | `AdmissionDischarge` `Age` `BodyPart` `ClinicalDept` `DateTime` `Disease` `Dosage_Strength` `Drug` `Duration` `Employment` `Form` `Frequency` `Gender` `Laterality` `Procedure` `PsychologicalCondition` `RelationshipStatus` `Route` `Symptom` `Test` `Vaccine` `VitalTest` |


*Example*:

```python
...
clinical_embeddings = WordEmbeddingsModel.pretrained("embeddings_clinical", "en", "clinical/models")\
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "token"])\
    .setOutputCol("embeddings")

ner_model = MedicalNerModel.pretrained("ner_vop_slim_wip", "en", "clinical/models")\
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "token","embeddings"])\
    .setOutputCol("ner")

sample_texts = ["Hello,I'm 20 year old girl. I'm diagnosed with hyperthyroid 1 month ago. I was feeling weak, poor digestion, depression, left chest pain, increased heart rate from 4 months. Also i have b12 deficiency so I'm taking weekly supplement of 1000 mcg b12 daily."]

#### New Entity Resolver Model for Mapping Rxnorm Codes According To the National Institute of Health (NIH) Database

We are releasing `sbiobertresolve_rxnorm_nih` pretrained model to map clinical entities and concepts (like drugs/ingredients) to RxNorm codes according to the National Institute of Health (NIH) database using `sbiobert_base_cased_mli` Sentence Bert Embeddings.

*Example*:

```python
...
rxnorm_resolver = SentenceEntityResolverModel.pretrained("sbiobertresolve_rxnorm_nih","en", "clinical/models") \
     .setInputCols(["sbert_embeddings"]) \
     .setOutputCol("resolution")\
     .setDistanceFunction("EUCLIDEAN")

text= "She is given folic acid 1 mg daily , levothyroxine 0.1 mg and aspirin 81 mg daily ."
```


*Result:*

```bash
| ner_chunk            | entity |rxnorm_code | all_codes                               | resolutions                                                                      |

 ```


 #### New Chunk Mapper Models For Mapping NDC Codes to Drug Brand Names As Well As Clinical Entities (like drugs/ingredients) to Rxnorm Codes

 We have two new chunk mapper models.

 + `ndc_drug_brandname_mapper` model maps NDC codes with their corresponding drug brand names as well as RxNorm Codes According to According to National Institute of Health (NIH).

*Example*:

```python
...
mapper = ChunkMapperModel.pretrained("ndc_drug_brandname_mapper", "en", "clinical/models")\
    .setInputCols("document")\
    .setOutputCol("mappings")\
    .setRels(["drug_brand_name"])\

text= ["0009-4992", "57894-150"]
```

 *Result:*

```bash
|    | ndc_code   | drug_brand_name   |
|---:|:-----------|:------------------|
|  0 | 0009-4992  | ZYVOX             |
|  1 | 57894-150  | ZYTIGA            |
```

+ `rxnorm_nih_mapper` model maps entities with their corresponding RxNorm codes according to the National Institute of Health (NIH) database. It returns Rxnorm codes along with their NIH Rxnorm Term Types within a parenthesis.

*Example*:

```python
...
chunkerMapper = ChunkMapperModel\
 .pretrained("rxnorm_nih_mapper", "en", "clinical/models")\
 .setInputCols(["ner_chunk"])\
 .setOutputCol("mappings")\
 .setRels(["rxnorm_code"])
```

 *Result*:

```bash
+-------------------------+-------------+-----------+
|ner_chunk                |mappings     |relation   |
+-------------------------+-------------+-----------+
|Adapin 10 MG Oral Capsule|1911002 (SY) |rxnorm_code|
|acetohexamide            |12250421 (IN)|rxnorm_code|
|Parlodel                 |829 (BN)     |rxnorm_code|
+-------------------------+-------------+-----------+
```

#### Format Consistency For Formatted Entity Obfuscation In `Deidentification` Module

We have added a new `setSameLengthFormattedEntities` parameter that obfuscates the formatted entities like `PHONE`, `FAX`, `ID`, `IDNUM`, `BIOID`, `MEDICALRECORD`, `ZIP`, `VIN`, `SSN`, `DLN`, `PLATE` and `LICENSE` with the fake ones in the same format. Default is an empty list (`[]`).

*Example*:

```python
obfuscated = DeIdentification()\
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "deid_ner_chunk"]) \
    .setOutputCol("obfuscated") \
    .setMode("obfuscate")\
    .setLanguage('en')\
    .setObfuscateDate(True)\
    .setObfuscateRefSource('faker')\
    .setSameLengthFormattedEntities(["PHONE","MEDICALRECORD", "IDNUM"])

sample_text = """Record date: 2003-01-13
Name : Hendrickson, Ora, Age: 25
MR: #7194334
ID: 1231511863
Phone: (302) 786-5227"""
```

*Result*:

```bash
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+------------------------------+
|                        sentence|                         masking|                   obfuscation|
+-------------------------------:+-------------------------------:+-----------------------------:+

+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+------------------------------+
```



#### New Parameters For Controlling The Validation Set While Training a NER Model With `MedicalNerApproach`

We added a new parameter to `MedicalNerApproach` for controlling the validation set while training.

+ `setRandomValidationSplitPerEpoch`: If it is `True`, the validation set is randomly splitted for each epoch; and if it is `False`, the split is done only once before training (the same validation split used after each epoch). Default is `False`.

*Example*:

```python
nerTagger = MedicalNerApproach()\
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "embeddings"])\
    .setLabelColumn("label")\
    .setValidationSplit(0.2)\
    .setRandomValidationSplitPerEpoch(True)\
    .setRandomSeed(42)\
    ...
```

#### Whitelisting The Entities While Merging Multiple Entities In `ChunkMergeApproach`

We have added `setWhiteList` parameter to `ChunkMergeApproach` annotator that you can whitelist detected entities while merging.

*Example*:

```python
chunk_merge = ChunkMergeApproach()\
      .setInputCols("deid_chunk_1", "deid_chunk_2")\
      .setOutputCol("merged_chunk")\
      .setMergeOverlapping(True)\
      #.setWhiteList(["AGE","DATE"])

sample_text = "Mr. ABC is a 25 years old with a nonproductive cough that started last week. He has a history of pericarditis in May 2006 and developed cough with right-sided chest pain, and admitted to Beverley Count Hospital."
```

*Result for without `WhiteList`*:

```bash
| index | ner_chunk               | entity   |
|-------|-------------------------|----------|
| 0     | John Smith              | PATIENT  |
| 1     | 25                      | AGE      |
| 2     | May 2006                | DATE     |
| 3     | Beverley Count Hospital | HOSPITAL |
```

*Result for with `WhiteList(["AGE","DATE"])`*:

```bash
| index | ner_chunk               | entity   |
|-------|-------------------------|----------|
| 0     | 25                      | AGE      |
| 1     | May 2006                | DATE     |
```
