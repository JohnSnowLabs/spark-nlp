Every project in Annotation Lab should have the following information:
- a unique *name* and a short description;
- a *team* of annotators, reviewers and a manager which will colaborate on the project;
- a *configuration* which specifies the type of annotations that will be created. 


To create a new project, click on the **Create Project** button on the **Home Page** and choose a name for it. The project can include a short description and annotation instructions/guidelines.

### Reserved words cannot be used in project names

The use of keywords like count, permission, or name as project names generated UI glitches. To avoid such issues, these keywords are no longer accepted as project names.

## Share your project with the annotation team

When working in teams, projects can be shared with other team members. 

 <img class="image image__shadow" src="/assets/images/annotation_lab/1.6.0/project_sharing.png" style="width:100%; align:center;"/>

The user who creates a project is called a **Project Owner**. He/She has complete visibility and ownership of the project for its entire lifecycle. If the Project Owner is removed from the user database, then all his/her projects are transfered to a new project owner. The Project Owner can edit the project configuration, can import/export tasks, can create a project team that will work on his project and can access project analytics.   
When defining the project team, a project owner has access to three distinct roles: **Annotator**, **Reviewer**, and **Manager**. These are very useful for most of the workflows that our users follow. 
 - An **Annotator** is able to see the tasks which have been assigned to him or her and can create annotations on the documents. 
 - The **Reviewer** is able to see the work of the annotators and approve it or reject in case he finds issues that need to be solved.  
 - The **Manager** is able to see the work of the Annotators and of the Reviewers and he can assign tasks to team members. This is useful for eliminating work overlap and for a better management of the work load.

To add a user to your project team, navigate to the Project Setup page. On the Manage Project Team tab, start typing the name of a user in the available text box. This will populate a list of available users having the username start with the caracters you typed. From the dropdown select the user you want to add to your team. Select a role for the user and click on the "Add to team" button.

## Supported Project Types
We currently support multiple predefined project configurations. The most popular ones are **Text Classification** and **Named Entity Recognition**. Create a setup from scratch or customize a predefined one according to your needs.


 <img class="image image__shadow" src="/assets/images/annotation_lab/predefined_configurations.png" style="width:100%; align:center;"/>

 
For customizing a predefined configuration, click on the corresponding link in the table above and then navigate to the Labeling config widget and manually edit/update it to contain the labels you need. 
 
After you finish editing the labels you want to define for your project click the “Save” button. 
 
## Text Classification Project

The Annotation Lab offers two types of classification widgets:

The first one supports single choice labels. You can activate it by choosing **Text Classification** from the list of predefined projects. The labels can be changed by directly editing them in the **Labeling Config** XML style widget. The updates will be automatically reflected in the right side preview. 

<img class="image image__shadow" src="/assets/images/annotation_lab/sent_analysis.png" style="width:100%; align:center;"/>


The second configuration offers support for multi-class classification. It can be activated by clicking on the **Multi classification** link in the list of predefined configurations. This option will add to the labeling config widget multiple checkboxes, grouped by headers. The names of the choices and well as the headers are customizable. You can also add new choices if necessary.

## Named Entity Recognition Project

Named Entity Recognition (NER) refers to the identification and classification of entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.


The **Annotation Lab** offers support for two types of labels: 
-	Simple labels for NER or assertion models;
-	Binary relations for relation extraction models. 

<img class="image image__shadow" src="/assets/images/annotation_lab/labels_def.png" style="width:100%; align:center;"/>

## Assertion Status Project
The syntax for defining an Assertion Status label is the same as for the NER labels, with an additional attribute - **assertion** which should be set to true (see example below). This is convention defined by Annotation Lab users which we exploited for identifying the labels to include in the training and prediction of Assertion Models.
A simple Labeling Config with Assertion Status defined should look like the following:

```bash
<View>
<Labels name="ner" toName="text">
	<Label value="Medicine" background="orange" hotkey="_"/>
	<Label value="Condition" background="orange" hotkey="_"/>
	<Label value="Procedure" background="green" hotkey="8"/>
	<Label value="Absent" assertion="true" background="red" hotkey="Z"/>
	<Label value="Past" assertion="true" background="red" hotkey="X"/>
</Labels>
<View style="height: 250px; overflow: auto;">
	<Text name="text" value="$text"/>
</View>
</View>
```
Notice assertion="true" in **Absent** and **Past** labels, which marks each of those labels as Assertion Status Labels.

## Labels customization
-	Names of the labels must be carefully chosen so they are easy to understand by the annotators. 
-	Highlighting colors can be assigned to each labels by either specifying the color name or the color code. 
-	Shortcuts keys can be assigned to each label to make the annotation process easier and faster. 

```bash
<Labels name="ner" toName="text">
    <Label value="Cancer" background="red" hotkey="c"/>
    <Label value="TumorSize" background="blue" hotkey="t"/>
    <Label value="TumorLocation" background="pink" hotkey="l"/>
    <Label value="Symptom" background="#dda0dd" hotkey="z"/>
  </Labels>
```

## Relations
The Annotation Lab also offers support for relation extraction. Relations are introduced by simply specifying their label. 

```bash
<Relations>
    <Relation value="CancerSize" />
    <Relation value="CancerLocation"/>
    <Relation value="MetastasisLocation"/>
  </Relations>
```

### Constraints for relation labeling

While annotating projects with Relations between Entities, defining constraints (the direction, the domain, the co-domain) of relations is important. Annotation Lab offers a way to define such constraints by editing the Project Configuration. The Project Owner or Project Managers can specify which Relation needs to be bound to which Labels and in which direction. This will hide some Relations in Labeling Page for NER Labels which will simplify the annotation process and will avoid the creation of any incorrect relations in the scope of the project.
To define such constraint, add allowed attribute to the <Relation> tag:
-  L1>L2 means Relation can be created in the direction from Label L1 to Label L2, but not the other way around
-  L1<>L2 means Relation can be created in either direction between Label L1 to Label L2

If the allowed attribute is not present in the tag, there is no such restriction. 

Bellow you can find a sample Project Configuration with Constraints for Relation Labels:

```bash
<View> 
<Header value="Sample Project Configuration for Relations Annotation"/> 
<Relations> 
    <Relation value="Was In" allowed="PERSON>LOC"/> 
    <Relation value="Has Function" allowed="LOC>EVENT,PERSON>MEDICINE"/> 
    <Relation value="Involved In" allowed="PERSON<>EVENT"/> 
    <Relation value="No Constraints"/> 
</Relations> 
<Labels name="label" toName="text"> 
    <Label value="PERSON"/> 
    <Label value="EVENT"/> 
    <Label value="MEDICINE"/> 
    <Label value="LOC"/> 
</Labels> 
<Text name="text" value="$text"/> 
</View>
```

 
## Project Validations

 Annotation Lab validates the defined configurations before allowing users to save them. Error messages are shown on the preview section. For instance, if the labels names do not align with the lables of the corresponding models an error is displayed. The same happens if reserved shortcut keys are used or if incompatible pretrained models are selected for preannotations.

## Delete a Project

To delete a project, on the *Home* screen click on the settings icon for that project. This will redirect you to the *Project Setup* screen where you will have the *Delete Project* button under the Project Instructions text area. Click on the *Delete Project* button and confirm the deletion by clicking on the *Yes* button on the popup. 


## Best practices

- Use Google Chrome. While Annotation Lab will work on other web browsers, we recommend using it on Google Chrome to ensure the best experience.

- Use one browser window at a time. Using the Annotation Lab web application via multiple sessions in parallel (i.e., multiple browser windows/tabs) connected with the same user account is not recommended.
