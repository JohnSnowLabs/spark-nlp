### Management of Preannotation and Training Servers

Annotation Lab 3.0.0 gives users the ability to view the list of all active servers. Any user can access the _Clusters_ page by navigating to `Settings > Clusters`. This page provides the following details.

- A summary of the status/limitations of the current infrastructure to run Spark NLP for Healthcare training jobs and/or pre-annotation servers.
- Ability to delete a server and free up resources when required, so that another training job and/or pre-annotation server can be started.
- Shows details of the server
  - **Server Name:** The name of server that can help identify it while running pre-annotation or importing files.
  - **License Used/Scope:** The license that is being used in the server and its scope.
  - **Usage:** Let the user know the usage of the server. A server can be used for pre-annotation, training, or OCR.
  - **Status:** Status of training and pre-annotation servers.
  - **Deployed By:** The user who deployed the server. This information might be useful for contacting the user who deployed a server before deleting it.
  - **Deployed At:** Shows when the server was deployed.

By default, only 1 server can be initialized for either pre-annotation or training even if there are multiple licenses present. To enable more than 1 servers to be initialized we need to update the below configuration parameter in `annotationlab-updater.sh` script inside the artifacts folder and then re-run it.

```bash
model_server.count=<NUMBER_OF_SERVER_TO_INITIALIZE>
airflow.model_server.count=<NUMBER_OF_SERVER_TO_INITIALIZE>
```

To run the script:

```
sudo ./annotationlab-updater.sh
```

#### Status of Training and Preannotation Server

A new column, status, is added to the Clusters page that gives the status of training and pre-annotation servers. The available pre-annotation server statuses are:

- Idle
- Busy
- Stopped

Users can visualize which servers are busy and which are idle. It is very useful information when the user intends to deploy a new server in replacement of an idle one. In this situation, the user can delete an idle server and deploy another pre-annotation/ training server.
This information is also available on the pre-annotation popup when the user selects the deployed server to use for pre-annotation.

Also, if any issues are encountered during server initialization, those are displayed on the tooltip accessible via mouse-over. Depending on the issue, changes might be required in the infrastructure settings, and the user will have to manually redeploy the training/pre-annotation server.
