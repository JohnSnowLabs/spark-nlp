## 2.7.2 

Release date: **28-02-2022**

Annotation Lab v2.7.2 includes Visual NER improvements 

### Bug Fixes 
- The text token in Visual NER project were missing in some cases when the labeling setting "Select regions after creating" was disabled. Now the setting is always enabled when labeling a Visual NER project. 
- Previously, without any changes made by the user on the configuration page "unsaved changes" message used to pop up. Now, the message only pops up when there is an unsaved configuration change.
