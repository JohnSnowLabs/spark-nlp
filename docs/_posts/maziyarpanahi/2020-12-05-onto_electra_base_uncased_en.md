## Description

Onto is a Named Entity Recognition (or NER) model trained on OntoNotes 5.0. It can extract up to 18 entities such as people, places, organizations, money, time, date, etc.

This model uses the pretrained `electra_base_uncased` embeddings model from the `BertEmbeddings` annotator as an input.

## Predicted Entities

`CARDINAL`, `DATE`, `EVENT`, `FAC`, `GPE`, `LANGUAGE`, `LAW`, `LOC`, `MONEY`, `NORP`, `ORDINAL`, `ORG`, `PERCENT`, `PERSON`, `PRODUCT`, `QUANTITY`, `TIME`, `WORK_OF_ART`.
