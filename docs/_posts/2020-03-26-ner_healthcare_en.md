## Description
Pretrained named entity recognition deep learning model for healthcare. Includes Problem, Test and Treatment entities. The SparkNLP deep learning model (NerDL) is inspired by a former state of the art model for NER: Chiu & Nicols, Named Entity Recognition with Bidirectional LSTM-CNN. 

{:.h2_title}
## Predicted Entities 
``PROBLEM``, ``TEST``, ``TREATMENT``.

## How to use

Use as part of an nlp pipeline with the following stages: DocumentAssembler, SentenceDetector, Tokenizer, WordEmbeddingsModel, NerDLModel. Add the NerConverter to the end of the pipeline to convert entity tokens into full entity chunks.

```python
...
clinical_ner = NerDLModel.pretrained("ner_healthcare", "en", "clinical/models") \
  .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "embeddings"]) \
  .setOutputCol("ner")
...
nlpPipeline = Pipeline(stages=[document_assembler, sentence_detector, tokenizer, word_embeddings, clinical_ner, ner_converter])

model = nlpPipeline.fit(spark.createDataFrame([["A 28-year-old female with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed eight years prior to presentation and subsequent type two diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ), one prior episode of HTG-induced pancreatitis three years prior to presentation , associated with an acute hepatitis , and obesity with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 33.5 kg/m2 , presented with a one-week history of polyuria , polydipsia , poor appetite , and vomiting .

## Results
The output is a dataframe with a sentence per row and a ``"ner"`` column containing all of the entity labels in the sentence, entity character indices, and other metadata. To get only the tokens and entity labels, without the metadata, select ``"token.result"`` and ``"ner.result"`` from your output dataframe or add the ``"Finisher"`` to the end of your pipeline.
```bash
|   | chunk                         | ner_label |
|---|-------------------------------|-----------|
| 0 | a respiratory tract infection | PROBLEM   |
| 1 | metformin                     | TREATMENT |
| 2 | glipizide                     | TREATMENT |
| 3 | dapagliflozin                 | TREATMENT |
| 4 | T2DM                          | PROBLEM   |
| 5 | atorvastatin                  | TREATMENT |
