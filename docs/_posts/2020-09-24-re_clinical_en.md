## Description
Relation Extraction model based on syntactic features using deep learning. Models the set of clinical relations defined in the 2010 ``i2b2`` relation challenge.

{:.h2_title}
## Included Relations 
`TrIP`: A certain treatment has improved or cured a medical problem (eg, ‘infection resolved with antibiotic course’)
`TrWP`: A patient's medical problem has deteriorated or worsened because of or in spite of a treatment being administered (eg, ‘the tumor was growing despite the drain’)
`TrCP`: A treatment caused a medical problem (eg, ‘penicillin causes a rash’)
`TrAP`: A treatment administered for a medical problem (eg, ‘Dexamphetamine for narcolepsy’)
`TrNAP`: The administration of a treatment was avoided because of a medical problem (eg, ‘Ralafen which is contra-indicated because of ulcers’)
`TeRP`: A test has revealed some medical problem (eg, ‘an echocardiogram revealed a pericardial effusion’)
`TeCP`: A test was performed to investigate a medical problem (eg, ‘chest x-ray done to rule out pneumonia’)
`PIP`: Two problems are related to each other (eg, ‘Azotemia presumed secondary to sepsis’)

## How to use 

<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">

{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPython.html %}

```python
...

reModel = RelationExtractionModel.pretrained("re_clinical","en","clinical/models")\
    .setInputCols(["word_embeddings","chunk","pos","dependency"])\
    .setOutput("relations")

pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[documenter, sentencer, tokenizer, words_embedder, pos_tagger, ner_tagger, ner_chunker, dependency_parser, reModel])
model = pipeline.fit(spark.createDataFrame([[""]]).toDF("text"))

results = LightPipeline(model).fullAnnotate("""A 28-year-old female with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed eight years prior to presentation and subsequent type two diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ), one prior episode of HTG-induced pancreatitis three years prior to presentation,  associated with an acute hepatitis , and obesity with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 33.5 kg/m2 , presented with a one-week history of polyuria , polydipsia , poor appetite , and vomiting . Two weeks prior to presentation , she was treated with a five-day course of amoxicillin for a respiratory tract infection . She was on metformin , glipizide , and dapagliflozin for T2DM and atorvastatin and gemfibrozil for HTG . She had been on dapagliflozin for six months at the time of presentation. Physical examination on presentation was significant for dry oral mucosa ; significantly , her abdominal examination was benign with no tenderness , guarding , or rigidity . Pertinent laboratory findings on admission were : serum glucose 111 mg/dl , bicarbonate 18 mmol/l , anion gap 20 , creatinine 0.4 mg/dL , triglycerides 508 mg/dL , total cholesterol 122 mg/dL , glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 10% , and venous pH 7.27 . Serum lipase was normal at 43 U/L . Serum acetone levels could not be assessed as blood samples kept hemolyzing due to significant lipemia . The patient was initially admitted for starvation ketosis , as she reported poor oral intake for three days prior to admission . However , serum chemistry obtained six hours after presentation revealed her glucose was 186 mg/dL , the anion gap was still elevated at 21 , serum bicarbonate was 16 mmol/L , triglyceride level peaked at 2050 mg/dL , and lipase was 52 U/L . The β-hydroxybutyrate level was obtained and found to be elevated at 5.29 mmol/L - the original sample was centrifuged and the chylomicron layer removed prior to analysis due to interference from turbidity caused by lipemia again . The patient was treated with an insulin drip for euDKA and HTG with a reduction in the anion gap to 13 and triglycerides to 1400 mg/dL , within 24 hours . Her euDKA was thought to be precipitated by her respiratory tract infection in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use . The patient was seen by the endocrinology service and she was discharged on 40 units of insulin glargine at night , 12 units of insulin lispro with meals , and metformin 1000 mg two times a day . It was determined that all SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued indefinitely . She had close follow-up with endocrinology post discharge .""")
