## Description
SentenceDetectorDL (SDDL) is based on a general-purpose neural network model for sentence boundary detection. The task of sentence boundary detection is to identify sentences within a text. Many natural language processing tasks take a sentence as an input unit, such as part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition or machine translation.

In this model, we treated the sentence boundary detection task as a classification problem based on a paper {Deep-EOS: General-Purpose Neural Networks for Sentence Boundary Detection (2020, Stefan Schweter, Sajawel Ahmed) using CNN architecture. We also modified the original implemenation a little bit to cover broken sentences and some impossible end of line chars.

## How to use 
<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">

{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPython.html %}

```python
documenter = DocumentAssembler()\
    .setInputCol("text")\
    .setOutputCol("document")
    
sentencerDL = SentenceDetectorDLModel\
  .pretrained("sentence_detector_dl", "en") \
  .setInputCols(["document"]) \
  .setOutputCol("sentences")

sd_model = LightPipeline(PipelineModel(stages=[documenter, sentencerDL]))
sd_model.fullAnnotate("""John loves Mary.Mary loves Peter. Peter loves Helen .Helen loves John; Total: four people involved.""")
```

```scala
val model = SentenceDetectorDLModel.pretrained("sentence_detector_dl_healthcare","en","clinical/models")
	.setInputCols(Array("document"))
