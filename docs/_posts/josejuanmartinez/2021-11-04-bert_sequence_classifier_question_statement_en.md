## Description

Trained to add sentence classifying capabilities to distinguish between Question vs Statements.

This model was imported from Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/shahrukhx01/question-vs-statement-classifier), and trained based on Haystack (https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/issues/611).

## Predicted Entities

`question`, `statement`

Years ago, my Dad bought me a cute little VW Beetle. The first day I had it, me and my BFF were sitting in my car looking at everything.
When we opened the center console, we had quite the scare. Inside was a hollowed out, plastic phallic looking object with tiny spikes on it.
My friend and I literally screamed in horror. It was clear to us that somehow someone left their “toy” in my new car! We were shook, as they say.
This was my car, I had to do something. So, I used a pen to pick up the nasty looking thing and threw it out.
We freaked out about how gross it was and then we forgot about it… until my Dad called me.
My Dad said: How’s the new car? Have you seen the flower holder in the center console?
To summarize, we thought a flower vase was an XXX item…
In our defense, this is a picture of a VW Beetle flower holder."""]
