## Description

This is a `sm` (small) version of a financial model, trained with more generic labels than the other versions of the model (`md`, `lg`, ...) you can find in Models Hub.

Please note this model requires some tokenization configuration to extract the currency (see python snippet below).

The aim of this model is to detect the main pieces of financial information in annual reports of companies, more specifically this model is being trained with 10K filings.

The currently available entities are:
- AMOUNT: Numeric amounts, not percentages
- PERCENTAGE: Numeric amounts which are percentages
- CURRENCY: The currency of the amount
- FISCAL_YEAR: A date which expresses which month the fiscal exercise was closed for a specific year
- DATE: Generic dates in context where either it's not a fiscal year or it can't be asserted as such given the context
- PROFIT: Profit or also Revenue
- PROFIT_INCREASE: A piece of information saying there was a profit / revenue increase in that fiscal year
- PROFIT_DECLINE: A piece of information saying there was a profit / revenue decrease in that fiscal year
- EXPENSE: An expense or loss
- EXPENSE_INCREASE: A piece of information saying there was an expense increase in that fiscal year
- EXPENSE_DECREASE: A piece of information saying there was an expense decrease in that fiscal year

You can also check for the Relation Extraction model which connects these entities together

## Predicted Entities

`AMOUNT`, `CURRENCY`, `DATE`, `FISCAL_YEAR`, `PERCENTAGE`, `EXPENSE`, `EXPENSE_INCREASE`, `EXPENSE_DECREASE`, `PROFIT`, `PROFIT_INCREASE`, `PROFIT_DECLINE`

Services revenue increased 4 %, or $ 1.1 million, to $ 25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $ 24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by $ 0.1 million, or 2 %, to $ 8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $ 8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to increase in internal staff costs of $ 1.1 million as we increased delivery staff and work performed on internal projects, partially offset by a decrease in third party consultant costs of $ 0.6 million as these were converted to internal staff or terminated. Also, a decrease in travel costs of $ 0.4 million due to travel restrictions caused by the global pandemic. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization was 34 % for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 20 %, or $ 1.5 million, to $ 6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $ 7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019."""]]).toDF("text")
