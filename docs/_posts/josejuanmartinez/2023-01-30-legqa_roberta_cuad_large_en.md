## Description

Legal RoBerta-based Question Answering model, trained on squad-v2, finetuned on CUAD dataset. In order to use it, a specific prompt is required. This is an example of it for extracting PARTIES:

```
"Highlight the parts (if any) of this contract related to "Parties" that should be reviewed by a lawyer. Details: The two or more parties who signed the contract"
```
