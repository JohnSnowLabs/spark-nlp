## Description


Trained to add sentence classifying capabilities to distinguish between Question vs Statements in clinical domain.


This model was imported from Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/shahrukhx01/question-vs-statement-classifier), trained based on Haystack (https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/issues/611) and finetuned by John Snow Labs with in-house clinical annotations.


## Predicted Entities


`question`, `statement`
