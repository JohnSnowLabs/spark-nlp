## How to use 
<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">

{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}

```python
...
pos = PerceptronModel.pretrained("pos_clinical","en","clinical/models")\
	.setInputCols(["token","sentence"])\
	.setOutputCol("pos")

pos_pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[document_assembler, sentence_detector, tokenizer, pos])
light_pipeline = LightPipeline(pos_pipeline.fit(spark.createDataFrame([[""]]).toDF("text")))
result = light_pipeline.fullAnnotate("""He was given boluses of MS04 with some effect, he has since been placed on a PCA - he take 80mg of oxycontin at home, his PCA dose is ~ 2 the morphine dose of the oxycontin, he has also received ativan for anxiety.""")
```

```scala
val pos = PerceptronModel.pretrained("pos_clinical","en","clinical/models")
	.setInputCols("token","sentence")
	.setOutputCol("pos")

val pipeline = new Pipeline().setStages(Array(document_assembler, sentence_detector, tokenizer, pos))
val data = Seq("He was given boluses of MS04 with some effect, he has since been placed on a PCA - he take 80mg of oxycontin at home, his PCA dose is ~ 2 the morphine dose of the oxycontin, he has also received ativan for anxiety.").toDF("text")
val result = pipeline.fit(data).transform(data)
```
