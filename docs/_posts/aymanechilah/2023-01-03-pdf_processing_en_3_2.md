## Description

This model obtain the text of an input PDF document with a Tesseract pretrained model. Tesseract is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine developed by Google. It is an open-source tool that can be used to recognize text in images and convert it into machine-readable text. The engine is based on a neural network architecture and uses machine learning algorithms to improve its accuracy over time.

Tesseract has been trained on a variety of datasets to improve its recognition capabilities. These datasets include images of text in various languages and scripts, as well as images with different font styles, sizes, and orientations. The training process involves feeding the engine with a large number of images and their corresponding text, allowing the engine to learn the patterns and characteristics of different text styles. One of the most important datasets used in training Tesseract is the UNLV dataset, which contains over 400,000 images of text in different languages, scripts, and font styles. This dataset is widely used in the OCR community and has been instrumental in improving the accuracy of Tesseract. Other datasets that have been used in training Tesseract include the ICDAR dataset, the IIIT-HWS dataset, and the RRC-GV-WS dataset.

In addition to these datasets, Tesseract also uses a technique called adaptive training, where the engine can continuously improve its recognition capabilities by learning from new images and text. This allows Tesseract to adapt to new text styles and languages, and improve its overall accuracy.

2	Alexandria is the second-largest city in Egypt and a major economic centre, extending about 32 km (20 mi) along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the north central part of the country. Its low elevation on the Nile delta makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez. Alexandria is also a popular tourist destination.
3	Alexandria was founded around a small, ancient Egyptian town c. 332 BC by Alexander the Great,[4] king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth, during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire. Alexandria became an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years, until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641, when a new capital was founded at Fustat (later absorbed into Cairo). Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library (the largest in the ancient world); and the Necropolis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages. Alexandria was at one time the second most powerful city of the ancient Mediterranean region, after Rome. Ongoing maritime archaeology in the harbor of Alexandria, which began in 1994, is revealing details of Alexandria both before the arrival of Alexander, when a city named Rhacotis existed there, and during the Ptolemaic dynasty.
