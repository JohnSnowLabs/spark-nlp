## How to use

<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">

{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPython.html %}

```python

era_pipeline = PretrainedPipeline('explain_clinical_doc_era', 'en', 'clinical/models')

annotations =  era_pipeline.fullAnnotate("""She is admitted to The John Hopkins Hospital 2 days ago with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed. She denied pain and any headache. She was seen by the endocrinology service and she was discharged on 03/02/2018 on 40 units of insulin glargine, 12 units of insulin lispro, and metformin 1000 mg two times a day. She had close follow-up with endocrinology post discharge. """)[0]

annotations.keys()

```

```scala
val era_pipeline = new PretrainedPipeline("explain_clinical_doc_era", "en", "clinical/models")

val result = era_pipeline.fullAnnotate("""She is admitted to The John Hopkins Hospital 2 days ago with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed. She denied pain and any headache.

## Results
The output is a dictionary with the following keys: ``'sentences'``, ``'clinical_ner_tags'``, ``'clinical_ner_chunks_re'``, ``'document'``, ``'clinical_ner_chunks'``, ``'assertion'``, ``'clinical_relations'``, ``'tokens'``, ``'embeddings'``, ``'pos_tags'``, ``'dependencies'``. Here is the result of `clinical_ner_chunks` :
