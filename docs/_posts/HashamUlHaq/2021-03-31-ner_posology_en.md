## Description

Pretrained named entity recognition deep learning model for posology, this NER is trained with the ``embeddings_clinical`` word embeddings model, so be sure to use the same embeddings in the pipeline.

## Predicted Entities

``DOSAGE``, ``DRUG``, ``DURATION``, ``FORM``, ``FREQUENCY``, ``ROUTE``, ``STRENGTH``.
