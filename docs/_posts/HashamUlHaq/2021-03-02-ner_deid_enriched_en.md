## Description

De-identification NER (Enriched) is a Named Entity Recognition model that annotates text to find protected health information that may need to be de-identified. The entities it annotates are Age, City, Country, Date, Doctor, Hospital, Idnum, Medicalrecord, Organization, Patient, Phone, Profession, State, Street, Username, and Zip. The model is trained with the `embeddings_clinical` word embeddings model, so be sure to use the same embeddings in the pipeline.

## Predicted Entities

`Age`, `City`, `Country`, `Date`, `Doctor`, `Hospital`, `Idnum`, `Medicalrecord`, `Organization`, `Patient`, `Phone`, `Profession`, `State`, `Street`, `Username`, `Zip`

He underwent a resection there. He was to be admitted to the Day Hospital for cystectomy. He was seen in Urology Clinic and Radiology Clinic on 02/04/2003. HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Smith presented to the Day Hospital in anticipation for Urology surgery. On evaluation, EKG, echocardiogram was abnormal, a Cardiology consult was obtained. A cardiac adenosine stress MRI was then proceeded, same was positive for inducible ischemia, mild-to-moderate inferolateral subendocardial infarction with peri-infarct ischemia. In addition, inducible ischemia seen in the inferior lateral septum. Mr. Smith underwent a left heart catheterization, which revealed two vessel coronary artery disease. The RCA, proximal was 95% stenosed and the distal 80% stenosed. The mid LAD was 85% stenosed and the distal LAD was 85% stenosed. There was four Multi-Link Vision bare metal stents placed to decrease all four lesions to 0%. Following intervention, Mr. Smith was admitted to 7 Ardmore Tower under Cardiology Service under the direction of Dr. Hart. Mr. Smith had a noncomplicated post-intervention hospital course. He was stable for discharge home on 02/07/2003 with instructions to take Plavix daily for one month and Urology is aware of the same."""]})))
