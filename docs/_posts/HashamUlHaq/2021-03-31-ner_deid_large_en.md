## Description

Deidentification NER (Large) is a Named Entity Recognition model that annotates text to find protected health information that may need to be deidentified. The entities it annotates are Age, Contact, Date, Id, Location, Name, and Profession. This model is trained with the `'embeddings_clinical'` word embeddings model, so be sure to use the same embeddings in the pipeline.

We sticked to official annotation guideline (AG) for 2014 i2b2 Deid challenge while annotating new datasets for this model. All the details regarding the nuances and explanations for AG can be found here [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4978170/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4978170/)

## Predicted Entities

`AGE`, `CONTACT`, `DATE`, `ID`, `LOCATION`, `NAME`, `PROFESSION`, `HEALTHPLAN`, `URL`.

A cardiac adenosine stress MRI was then proceeded, same was positive for inducible ischemia, mild-to-moderate inferolateral subendocardial infarction with peri-infarct ischemia. In addition, inducible ischemia seen in the inferior lateral septum. Mr. Smith underwent a left heart catheterization, which revealed two vessel coronary artery disease.

There was four Multi-Link Vision bare metal stents placed to decrease all four lesions to 0%. Following intervention, Mr. Smith was admitted to 7 Ardmore Tower under Cardiology Service under the direction of Dr. Hart. Mr. Smith had a noncomplicated post-intervention hospital course.
