## Description

Automatically detect positive, negative and neutral aspects about restaurants from user reviews. Instead of labelling the entire review as negative or positive, this model helps identify which exact phrases relate to sentiment identified in the review.

## Predicted Entities

`NEG` `POS`

## How to use

Use as part of an nlp pipeline with the following stages: DocumentAssembler, SentenceDetector, Tokenizer, WordEmbeddingsModel, NerDLModel. Add the NerConverter to the end of the pipeline to convert entity tokens into full entity chunks.

```python
...
word_embeddings = WordEmbeddingsModel.pretrained("glove_6B_300", "xx")\
    .setInputCols(["document", "token"])\

ner_model = NerDLModel.pretrained("ner_aspect_based_sentiment")\
    .setInputCols(["document", "token", "embeddings"])\
    .setOutputCol("ner")
...
nlp_pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[document_assembler, sentence_detector, tokenizer, word_embeddings, ner_model, ner_converter])
model = nlp_pipeline.fit(spark.createDataFrame([[""]]).toDF("text"))
results = model.transform(spark.createDataFrame([["Came for lunch my sister. We loved our Thai-style main which amazing with lots of flavours very impressive for vegetarian. But the service was below average and the chips were too terrible to finish."]]).toDF("text"))
```
```scala

val pipeline = new Pipeline().setStages(Array(document_assembler, sentence_detector, tokenizer, word_embeddings, ner_model, ner_converter))
val result = pipeline.fit(Seq.empty["Came for lunch my sister. We loved our Thai-style main which amazing with lots of flavours very impressive for vegetarian. But the service was below average and the chips were too terrible to finish."].toDS.toDF("text")).transform(data)
```

ner_df = nlu.load('en.ner.aspect_sentiment').predict(text, output_level='token')
list(zip(ner_df["entities"].values[0], ner_df["entities_confidence"].values[0])
