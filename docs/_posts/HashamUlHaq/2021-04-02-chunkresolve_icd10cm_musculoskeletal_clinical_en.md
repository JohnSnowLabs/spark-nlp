## How to use

{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}
```python

Mom states she had no fever. Her appetite was good but she was spitting up a lot. She had no difficulty breathing and her cough was described as dry and hacky. At that time, physical exam showed a right TM, which was red. Left TM was okay. She was fairly congested but looked happy and playful. She was started on Amoxil and Aldex and we told to recheck in 2 weeks to recheck her ear. Mom returned to clinic again today because she got much worse overnight. She was having difficulty breathing. She was much more congested and her appetite had decreased significantly today. She also spiked a temperature yesterday of 102.6 and always having trouble sleeping secondary to congestion."""]]).toDF("text"))
