## Description

Deidentification NER (Large) is a Named Entity Recognition model that annotates text to find protected health information that may need to be deidentified. The entities it annotates are Age, Contact, Date, Id, Location, Name, and Profession. This model is trained with the 'embeddings_clinical' word embeddings model, so be sure to use the same embeddings in the pipeline.

## Predicted Entities

`AGE`, `CONTACT`, `DATE`, `ID`, `LOCATION`, `NAME`, `PROFESSION`.

HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Smith presented to the Day Hospital in anticipation for Urology surgery. On evaluation, EKG, echocardiogram was abnormal, a Cardiology consult was obtained. A cardiac adenosine stress MRI was then proceeded, same was positive for inducible ischemia, mild-to-moderate inferolateral subendocardial infarction with peri-infarct ischemia. In addition, inducible ischemia seen in the inferior lateral septum. Mr. Smith underwent a left heart catheterization, which revealed two vessel coronary artery disease. The RCA, proximal was 95% stenosed and the distal 80% stenosed. The mid LAD was 85% stenosed and the distal LAD was 85% stenosed. There was four Multi-Link Vision bare metal stents placed to decrease all four lesions to 0%. Following intervention, Mr. Smith was admitted to 7 Ardmore Tower under Cardiology Service under the direction of Dr. Hart. Mr. Smith had a noncomplicated post-intervention hospital course. He was stable for discharge home on 02/07/2003 with instructions to take Plavix daily for one month and Urology is aware of the same."""]
