## Description




Pretrained named entity recognition deep learning model for clinical terminology. This model is trained with `BertForTokenClassification` method from `transformers` library and imported into Spark NLP. It detects 77 entities.




## Predicted Entities

`Medical_Device`, `Physical_Measurement`, `Alergen`, `Procedure`, `Substance_Quantity`, `Drug`, `Test_Result`, `Pregnancy_Newborn`, `Admission_Discharge`, `Demographics`, `Lifestyle`, `Header`, `Date_Time`, `Treatment`, `Clinical_Dept`, `Test`, `Death_Entity`, `Age`, `Oncological`, `Body_Part`, `Birth_Entity`, `Vital_Sign`, `Symptom`, `Disease_Syndrome_Disorder`
