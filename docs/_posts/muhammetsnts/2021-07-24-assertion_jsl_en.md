## Description

The deep neural network architecture for assertion status detection in Spark NLP is based on a BiLSTM framework, and is a modified version of the architecture proposed by Fancellu et.al. (Fancellu, Lopez, and Webber 2016). Its goal is to classify the assertions made on given medical concepts as being present, absent, or possible in the patient, conditionally present in the patient under certain circumstances, hypothetically present in the patient at some future point, and mentioned in the patient report but associated with someoneelse (Uzuner et al. 2011).

## Predicted Entities

`Present`, `Absent`, `Possible`, `Planned`, `Someoneelse`, `Past`, `Family`, `None`, `Hypotetical`.

One day ago, mom also noticed a tactile temperature and gave the patient Tylenol. Baby also has had some decreased p.o. intake. His normal breast-feeding is down from 20 minutes q.2h. to 5 to 10 minutes secondary to his respiratory congestion. He sleeps well, but has been more tired and has been fussy over the past 2 days. The parents noticed no improvement with albuterol treatments given in the ER. His urine output has also decreased; normally he has 8 to 10 wet and 5 dirty diapers per 24 hours, now he has down to 4 wet diapers per 24 hours. Mom denies any diarrhea. His bowel movements are yellow colored and soft in nature."]], ["text"])

## Results

```bash
The output is a dataframe with a sentence per row and an `assertion` column containing all of the assertion labels in the sentence. The assertion column also contains assertion character indices, and other metadata. To get only the entity chunks and assertion labels, without the metadata, select `ner_chunk.result` and `assertion.result` from your output dataframe.
