## Description

This model maps extracted medical entities to ICD-O codes using sBioBert sentence embeddings. This model is augmented using the site information coming from ICD10 and synonyms coming from SNOMED vocabularies. It is trained with a dataset that is 20x larger than the previous version of ICDO resolver.

Given an oncological entity found in the text (via NER models like ner_jsl), it returns top terms and resolutions along with the corresponding ICD-O codes to present more granularity with respect to body parts mentioned. It also returns the original `Topography` codes, `Morphology` codes comprising of `Histology` and `Behavior` codes, and descriptions.

## Predicted Entities

ICD-O Codes and their normalized definition with `sbiobert_base_cased_mli ` embeddings.
