## Description


This model detects molecular biology-related terms in medical texts. This model is trained with the `BertForTokenClassification` method from the `transformers` library and imported into Spark NLP.


## Predicted Entities


`DNA`, `Cell_type`, `Cell_line`, `RNA`, `Protein`

To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of transactivation by Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE-1), we developed a genetic approach with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We constructed a yeast reporter strain containing the lacZ gene under the control of the CYC1 promoter associated with three copies of TRE-1. Expression of either the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) or CREB fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAD) in this strain did not modify the expression of the reporter gene. Tax alone was also inactive."""
