## Description

Deidentification NER (Augmented) is a Named Entity Recognition model that annotates text to find protected health information that may need to be deidentified.

## Predicted Entities

`AGE`, `CONTACT`, `DATE`, `ID`, `LOCATION`, `NAME`, `PROFESSION`

## How to use

This model is trained with the ‘embeddings_clinical’ word embeddings, so be sure to use the same embeddings within the pipeline in addition to document assembler, sentence detector, tokenizer and ner converter .

```python
model = NerDLModel.pretrained("ner_deid_augmented","en","clinical/models")\
	.setInputCols(["sentence","token","word_embeddings"])\
	.setOutputCol("ner")

nlpPipeline = Pipeline(stages=[document_assembler, sentence_detector, tokenizer, word_embeddings, model, ner_converter])

model = nlpPipeline.fit(spark.createDataFrame([[""]]).toDF("text"))

He underwent a resection there. He was to be admitted to the Day Hospital for cystectomy. He was seen in Urology Clinic and Radiology Clinic on 02/04/2003. HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Smith presented to the Day Hospital in anticipation for Urology surgery. On evaluation, EKG, echocardiogram was abnormal, a Cardiology consult was obtained. A cardiac adenosine stress MRI was then proceeded, same was positive for inducible ischemia, mild-to-moderate inferolateral subendocardial infarction with peri-infarct ischemia. In addition, inducible ischemia seen in the inferior lateral septum. Mr. Smith underwent a left heart catheterization, which revealed two vessel coronary artery disease. The RCA, proximal was 95% stenosed and the distal 80% stenosed. The mid LAD was 85% stenosed and the distal LAD was 85% stenosed. There was four Multi-Link Vision bare metal stents placed to decrease all four lesions to 0%. Following intervention, Mr. Smith was admitted to 7 Ardmore Tower under Cardiology Service under the direction of Dr. Hart. Mr. Smith had a noncomplicated post-intervention hospital course. He was stable for discharge home on 02/07/2003 with instructions to take Plavix daily for one month and Urology is aware of the same. """]})))
