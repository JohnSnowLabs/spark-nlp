## Description

Deidentify (DL) is a deidentification model. It identifies instances of protected health information in text documents, and it can either obfuscate them (e.g., replacing names with different, fake names) or mask them (e.g., replacing “2020-06-04” with “<DATE>”). This model is useful for maintaining HIPAA compliance when dealing with text documents that contain protected health information.

## How to use

Use as a downstream task of a pipeline including one of Spark NLP  deidentification ner models (i.e. `ner_deid_large`)

<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">
{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}
```python
...
deid_ner = NerDLModel.pretrained("ner_deid_large", "en", "clinical/models") \
  .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "embeddings"]) \
  .setOutputCol("ner")

nlp_pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[documentAssembler, sentenceDetector, tokenizer, word_embeddings, deid_ner, ner_converter]) 

result = nlp_pipeline.transform(spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame({'text': ["""Patient AIQING, 25 month years-old , born in Beijing, was transfered to the The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Phone number: (541) 754-3010. MSW 100009632582 for his colonic polyps. He wants to know the results from them. He is not taking hydrochlorothiazide and is curious about his blood pressure. He said he has cut his alcohol back to 6 pack once a week. He has cut back his cigarettes to one time per week. P:   Follow up with Dr. Hobbs in 3 months. Gilbert P. Perez, M.D."""]})))

deid= DeIdentificationModel.pretrained("deidentify_dl", "en", "clinical/models") \
      .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "ner_chunk"]) \
      .setOutputCol("obfuscated") \
      .setMode("obfuscate")

deid_text = deid.transform(result)
```

</div>
