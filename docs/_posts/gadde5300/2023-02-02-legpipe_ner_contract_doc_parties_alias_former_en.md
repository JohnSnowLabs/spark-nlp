## Description

IMPORTANT: Don't run this pretrained pipeline on the whole legal agreement. Instead:
- Split by paragraphs. You can use [notebook 1](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/tree/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings_JSL) in Finance or Legal as inspiration;
- Use the `legclf_introduction_clause` Text Classifier to select only these paragraphs; 

This is a Legal NER Pipeline, aimed to process the first page of the agreements when information can be found about:
- Parties of the contract/agreement;
- Aliases of those parties, or how those parties will be called further on in the document;
- Document Type;
- Effective Date of the agreement;

This pretrained pipeline can be used all along with its Relation Extraction model to retrieve the relations between these entities, called `legre_contract_doc_parties`

Other models can be found to detect other parts of the document, as Headers/Subheaders, Signers, "Will-do", etc.
