## Description
Deidentify (Large) is a deidentification model. It identifies instances of protected health information in text documents, and it can either obfuscate them (e.g., replacing names with different, fake names) or mask them (e.g., replacing "2020-06-04" with "&lt;DATE&gt;"). This model is useful for maintaining HIPAA compliance when dealing with text documents that contain protected health information.
