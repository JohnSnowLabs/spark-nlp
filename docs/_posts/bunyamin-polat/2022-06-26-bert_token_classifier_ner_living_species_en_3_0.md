## Description

Extract living species from clinical texts which is critical to scientific disciplines like medicine, biology, ecology/biodiversity, nutrition and agriculture. This model is trained with the `BertForTokenClassification` method from the `transformers` library and imported into Spark NLP.

It is trained on the [LivingNER](https://temu.bsc.es/livingner/2022/05/03/multilingual-corpus/) corpus that is composed of clinical case reports extracted from miscellaneous medical specialties including COVID, oncology, infectious diseases, tropical medicine, urology, pediatrics, and others.

**NOTE :**
- The text files were translated from Spanish with a neural machine translation system.
- The annotations were translated with the same neural machine translation system.
- The translated annotations were transferred to the translated text files using an annotation transfer technology.

## Predicted Entities

`HUMAN`, `SPECIES`
