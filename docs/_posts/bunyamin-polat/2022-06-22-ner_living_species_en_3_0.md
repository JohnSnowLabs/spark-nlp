## Description

Extract living species from clinical texts which is critical to scientific disciplines like medicine, biology, ecology/biodiversity, nutrition and agriculture.

It is trained on the [LivingNER](https://temu.bsc.es/livingner/2022/05/03/multilingual-corpus/) corpus that is composed of clinical case reports extracted from miscellaneous medical specialties including COVID, oncology, infectious diseases, tropical medicine, urology, pediatrics, and others.

**NOTE :**
1.	The text files were translated from Spanish with a neural machine translation system.
2.	The annotations were translated with the same neural machine translation system.
3.	The translated annotations were transferred to the translated text files using an annotation transfer technology.

## Predicted Entities

`HUMAN`, `SPECIES`
