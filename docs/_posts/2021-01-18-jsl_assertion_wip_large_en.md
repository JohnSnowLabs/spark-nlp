## Description

The deep neural network architecture for assertion status detection in Spark NLP is based on a BiLSTM framework, and is a modified version of the architecture proposed by Fancellu et.al. (Fancellu, Lopez, and Webber 2016). Its goal is to classify the assertions made on given medical concepts as being present, absent, or possible in the patient, conditionally present in the patient under certain circumstances, hypothetically present in the patient at some future point, and mentioned in the patient report but associated with someone- else (Uzuner et al. 2011). Apart from what we released in other assertion models, an in-house annotations on a curated dataset (6K clinical notes) is used to augment the base assertion dataset (2010 i2b2/VA).

## How to use

Use as part of an nlp pipeline with the following stages: DocumentAssembler, SentenceDetector, Tokenizer, WordEmbeddingsModel, NerDLModel, NerConverter, AssertionDLModel.

## Results
The output is a dataframe with a sentence per row and an ``"assertion"`` column containing all of the assertion labels in the sentence. The assertion column also contains assertion character indices, and other metadata. To get only the entity chunks and assertion labels, without the metadata, select ``"ner_chunk.result"`` and ``"assertion.result"`` from your output dataframe.
