## Description

Pretrained named entity recognition deep learning model for clinical terminology. The SparkNLP deep learning model (NerDL) is inspired by a former state of the art model for NER: Chiu & Nicols, Named Entity Recognition with Bidirectional LSTM-CNN. 

## Predicted Entities 
`Age`, `Diagnosis`, `Dosage`, `Drug_Name`, `Frequency`, `Gender`, `Lab_Name`, `Lab_Result`, `Symptom_Name`.

## How to use
Use as part of an nlp pipeline with the following stages: DocumentAssembler, SentenceDetector, Tokenizer, WordEmbeddingsModel, NerDLModel. Add the NerConverter to the end of the pipeline to convert entity tokens into full entity chunks.

One day ago, mom also noticed a tactile temperature and gave the patient Tylenol. Baby also has had some decreased p.o. intake. His normal breast-feeding is down from 20 minutes q.2h. to 5 to 10 minutes secondary to his respiratory congestion. He sleeps well, but has been more tired and has been fussy over the past 2 days. The parents noticed no improvement with albuterol treatments given in the ER. His urine output has also decreased; normally he has 8 to 10 wet and 5 dirty diapers per 24 hours, now he has down to 4 wet diapers per 24 hours. Mom denies any diarrhea.

## Results
The output is a dataframe with a sentence per row and a ``"ner"`` column containing all of the entity labels in the sentence, entity character indices, and other metadata. To get only the tokens and entity labels, without the metadata, select ``"token.result"`` and ``"ner.result"`` from your output dataframe or add the ``"Finisher"`` to the end of your pipeline.
