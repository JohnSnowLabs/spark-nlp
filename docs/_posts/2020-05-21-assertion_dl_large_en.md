## Description

Deep learning named entity recognition model for assertions. The SparkNLP deep learning model (NerDL) is inspired by a former state of the art model for NER: Chiu & Nicols, Named Entity Recognition with Bidirectional LSTM-CNN.

## Predicted Labels
``hypothetical``, ``present``, ``absent``, ``possible``, ``conditional``, ``associated_with_someone_else``.

## How to use
Use as part of an nlp pipeline with the following stages: DocumentAssembler, SentenceDetector, Tokenizer, WordEmbeddingsModel, NerDLModel, NerConverter, AssertionDLModel.

```python
...
clinical_assertion = AssertionDLModel.pretrained("assertion_dl_large", "en", "clinical/models") \
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "ner_chunk", "embeddings"]) \
    .setOutputCol("assertion")
    
nlpPipeline = Pipeline(stages=[documentAssembler, sentenceDetector, tokenizer, word_embeddings, nerDLModel, nerConverter, clinical_assertion])

model = nlpPipeline.fit(spark.createDataFrame([["Patient with severe fever and sore throat. He shows no stomach pain and he maintained on an epidural and PCA for pain control. He also became short of breath with climbing a flight of stairs. After CT, lung tumor located at the right lower lobe. Father with Alzheimer."]]).toDF("text"))

light_model = LightPipeline(model)

```

```scala
...
val clinical_assertion = AssertionDLModel.pretrained("assertion_dl_large", "en", "clinical/models")
    .setInputCols(Array("sentence", "ner_chunk", "embeddings"))
    .setOutputCol("assertion")

val pipeline = new Pipeline().setStages(Array(documentAssembler, sentenceDetector, tokenizer, word_embeddings, nerDLModel, nerConverter, clinical_assertion))

val result = pipeline.fit(Seq.empty["Patient with severe fever and sore throat. He shows no stomach pain and he maintained on an epidural and PCA for pain control. He also became short of breath with climbing a flight of stairs. After CT, lung tumor located at the right lower lobe. Father with Alzheimer."].toDS.toDF("text")).transform(data)
```

## Results
The output is a dataframe with a sentence per row and an ``"assertion"`` column containing all of the assertion labels in the sentence. The assertion column also contains assertion character indices, and other metadata. To get only the entity chunks and assertion labels, without the metadata, select ``"ner_chunk.result"`` and ``"assertion.result"`` from your output dataframe.

```bash
           chunks  entities  assertion

0    severe fever   PROBLEM  present
1     sore throat   PROBLEM  present
2    stomach pain   PROBLEM  absent
3     an epidural TREATMENT  present
4             PCA TREATMENT  present
5    pain control   PROBLEM  present
6 short of breath   PROBLEM  conditional
7              CT      TEST  present
8      lung tumor   PROBLEM  present
9       Alzheimer   PROBLEM  associated_with_someone_else
```
