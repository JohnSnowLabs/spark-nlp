## Description

This model was imported from `Hugging Face` ([link](https://huggingface.co/tasosk/distilbert-base-uncased-airlines)) and it's been trained on tasosk/airlines dataset, leveraging `Distil-BERT` embeddings and `DistilBertForSequenceClassification` for text classification purposes. The model classifies texts into two categories: `YES` for positive comments, and `NO` for negative.

## Predicted Entities

`YES`, `NO`

```python

Due to the flight time, airport check-in was not open, however I'd checked in a few days before with the easyJet app which was very quick and convenient. Boarding was quick and we left a few minutes early, which is a bonus. The cabin crew were friendly and the aircraft was clean and comfortable. We arrived at Gatwick 5-10 minutes early, and disembarking was as quick as boarding. On the way back, we were about half an hour early landing, which was fantastic. For the short flight from JER-LGW, easyJet are ideal and a bit better than British Airways in my opinion, and the fares are just unmissable. Both flights for two adults cost £180. easyJet can expect my business in the near future."]]).toDF("text")
