## Description

This model is trained with `clinical_embeddings` to extract the names of chemical compounds and drugs in medical texts. The entities that can be detected are as follows :

- `SYSTEMATIC` : Systematic names of chemical mentions, e.g. IUPAC and IUPAC-like names.(e.g. 2-Acetoxybenzoic acid, 2-Acetoxybenzenecarboxylic acid)
- `IDENTIFIERS` : Database identifiers of chemicals: CAS numbers, PubChem identifiers, registry numbers and ChEBI and CHEMBL ids. (e.g. CAS Registry Number: 501-36-0445154 CID 445154, CHEBI:28262, CHEMBL504)
- `FORMULA` : Mentions of molecular formula, SMILES, InChI, InChIKey. (e.g. CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O, C9H8O4)
- `TRIVIAL` : Trivial, trade (brand), common or generic names of compounds. It includes International Nonproprietary Name (INN) as well as British Approved Name (BAN) and United States Adopted Name (USAN). (e.g. Aspirin, Acylpyrin, paracetamol)
- `ABBREVIATION` : Mentions of abbreviations and acronyms of chemicals compounds and drugs. (e.g. DMSO, GABA)
- `FAMILY`: Chemical families that can be associated to some chemical structure are also included. (e.g. Iodopyridazines (FAMILY- SYSTEMATIC))
- `MULTIPLE` : Mentions that do correspond to chemicals that are not described in a continuous string of characters. This is often the case of mentions of multiple chemicals joined by coordinated clauses. (e.g. thieno2,3-d and thieno3,2-d fused oxazin-4-ones)

## Predicted Entities

`SYSTEMATIC`, `IDENTIFIERS`, `FORMULA`, `TRIVIAL`, `ABBREVIATION`, `FAMILY`, `MULTIPLE`
