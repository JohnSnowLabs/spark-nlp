Pretrained named entity recognition deep learning model for Drugs. This model is traiend with `BertForTokenClassification` method from `transformers` library and imported into Spark NLP. It detects drug chemicals.

## Predicted Entities

`DrugChem`

Here we describe the genomicorganization of the KCNJ9 locus on chromosome 1q21-23 as a candidate gene forType II diabetes mellitus in the Pima Indian population. The gene spansapproximately 7.6 kb and contains one noncoding and two coding exons separated byapproximately 2.2 and approximately 2.6 kb introns, respectively. We identified14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including one that predicts aVal366Ala substitution, and an 8 base-pair (bp) insertion/deletion. Ourexpression studies revealed the presence of the transcript in various humantissues including pancreas, and two major insulin-responsive tissues: fat andskeletal muscle. The characterization of the KCNJ9 gene should facilitate furtherstudies on the function of the KCNJ9 protein and allow evaluation of thepotential role of the locus in Type II diabetes.BACKGROUND: At present, it is one of the most important issues for the treatment of breast cancer to develop the standard therapy for patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes. With the objective of determining the usefulnessof vinorelbine monotherapy in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancerafter standard therapy, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of vinorelbine inpatients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes."""
