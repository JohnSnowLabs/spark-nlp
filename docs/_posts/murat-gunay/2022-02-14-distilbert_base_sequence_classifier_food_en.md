## Description

This model was imported from `Hugging Face` ([link](https://huggingface.co/Tejas3/distillbert_base_uncased_amazon_food_review_300)) and it's been trained on Amazon Food Review dataset, leveraging `Distil-BERT` embeddings and `DistilBertForSequenceClassification` for text classification purposes. The model classifies `Positive` or `Negative` sentiments of texts related to food reviews.

## Predicted Entities

`Positive`, `Negative`
