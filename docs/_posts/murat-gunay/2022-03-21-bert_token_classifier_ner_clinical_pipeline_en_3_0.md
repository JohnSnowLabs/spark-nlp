## How to use



<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">
{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}
```python
pipeline = PretrainedPipeline("bert_token_classifier_ner_clinical_pipeline", "en", "clinical/models")


pipeline.annotate("A 28-year-old female with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed eight years prior to presentation and subsequent type two diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ), one prior episode of HTG-induced pancreatitis three years prior to presentation , associated with an acute hepatitis , and obesity with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 33.5 kg/m2 , presented with a one-week history of polyuria , polydipsia , poor appetite , and vomiting . Two weeks prior to presentation , she was treated with a five-day course of amoxicillin for a respiratory tract infection . She was on metformin , glipizide , and dapagliflozin for T2DM and atorvastatin and gemfibrozil for HTG . She had been on dapagliflozin for six months at the time of presentation . Physical examination on presentation was significant for dry oral mucosa ; significantly , her abdominal examination was benign with no tenderness , guarding , or rigidity . Pertinent laboratory findings on admission were : serum glucose 111 mg/dl , bicarbonate 18 mmol/l , anion gap 20 , creatinine 0.4 mg/dL , triglycerides 508 mg/dL , total cholesterol 122 mg/dL , glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 10% , and venous pH 7.27 . Serum lipase was normal at 43 U/L . Serum acetone levels could not be assessed as blood samples kept hemolyzing due to significant lipemia . The patient was initially admitted for starvation ketosis , as she reported poor oral intake for three days prior to admission . However , serum chemistry obtained six hours after presentation revealed her glucose was 186 mg/dL , the anion gap was still elevated at 21 , serum bicarbonate was 16 mmol/L , triglyceride level peaked at 2050 mg/dL , and lipase was 52 U/L . The β-hydroxybutyrate level was obtained and found to be elevated at 5.29 mmol/L - the original sample was centrifuged and the chylomicron layer removed prior to analysis due to interference from turbidity caused by lipemia again . The patient was treated with an insulin drip for euDKA and HTG with a reduction in the anion gap to 13 and triglycerides to 1400 mg/dL , within 24 hours . Her euDKA was thought to be precipitated by her respiratory tract infection in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use . The patient was seen by the endocrinology service and she was discharged on 40 units of insulin glargine at night , 12 units of insulin lispro with meals , and metformin 1000 mg two times a day . It was determined that all SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued indefinitely . She had close follow-up with endocrinology post discharge .")
