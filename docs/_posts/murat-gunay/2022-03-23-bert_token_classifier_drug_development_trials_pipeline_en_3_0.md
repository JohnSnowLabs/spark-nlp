## How to use






<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">
{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}

```python
from sparknlp.pretrained import PretrainedPipeline

pipeline = PretrainedPipeline("bert_token_classifier_drug_development_trials_pipeline", "en", "clinical/models")


pipeline.fullAnnotate("In June 2003, the median overall survival  with and without topotecan were 4.0 and 3.6 months, respectively. The best complete response  ( CR ) , partial response  ( PR ) , stable disease and progressive disease were observed in 23, 63, 55 and 33 patients, respectively, with  topotecan,  and 11, 61, 66 and 32 patients, respectively, without topotecan.")
```
```scala
import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.pretrained.PretrainedPipeline

val pipeline = new PretrainedPipeline("bert_token_classifier_drug_development_trials_pipeline", "en", "clinical/models")


pipeline.fullAnnotate("In June 2003, the median overall survival  with and without topotecan were 4.0 and 3.6 months, respectively. The best complete response  ( CR ) , partial response  ( PR ) , stable disease and progressive disease were observed in 23, 63, 55 and 33 patients, respectively, with  topotecan,  and 11, 61, 66 and 32 patients, respectively, without topotecan.")
