## Description


Detect symptoms, modifiers, age, drugs, treatments, tests and a lot more using a single pretrained NER model.


## Predicted Entities


`Symptom_Name`, `Pulse_Rate`, `Negation`, `Age`, `Modifier`, `Substance_Name`, `Causative_Agents_(Virus_and_Bacteria)`, `Diagnosis`, `Weight`, `Drug_Name`, `Procedure_Name`, `Lab_Name`, `Blood_Pressure`, `Lab_Result`, `Gender`, `Name`, `Temperature`, `Section_Name`, `Route`, `Maybe`, `O2_Saturation`, `Respiratory_Rate`, `Procedure`, `Frequency`, `Dosage`, `Allergenic_substance`
