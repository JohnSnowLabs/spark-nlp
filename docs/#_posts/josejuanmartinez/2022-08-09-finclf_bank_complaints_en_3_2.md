## How to use



<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">
{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}

```python
document_assembler = nlp.DocumentAssembler() \
    .setInputCol("text") \
    .setOutputCol("document")

embeddings = nlp.UniversalSentenceEncoder.pretrained() \
      .setInputCols("document") \
      .setOutputCol("sentence_embeddings")

classsifier_dl = nlp.ClassifierDLModel.pretrained("finclf_bank_complaints", "en", "finance/models")\
      .setInputCols(["sentence_embeddings"])\
      .setOutputCol("label")\

clf_pipeline = Pipeline(
    stages = [
        document_assembler,
        embeddings,
        classsifier_dl
    ])
    
light_pipeline = LightPipeline(clf_pipeline.fit(spark.createDataFrame([['']]).toDF("text")))

result = light_pipeline.annotate("""Over the course of 30 days I have filed a dispute in regards to inaccurate and false information on my credit report. Ive attached a copy of my dispute mailed in certified to Equifax and they are still reporting these incorrect items. According to the fair credit ACT, section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) they are required by Federal Law to only report Accurate information and the have not done so. They have not provided me with any proof i.e. and original consumer contract with my signature on it proving that this is my account.Further more, I would like to make a formal complaint that Ive tried calling Equifax Over 10 times this week and every single time Ive called Ive asked for a representative in the fraud dispute department wants transfer it over there when you speak to the representative and let them know that you are looking to dispute inquiries and accounts due to fraud they immediately transfer you to their survey line essentially ending the call. I believe Equifax is training their representatives to not help consumers over the phone and performing unethical practices. Once I finally got a hold of a representative she told me that she could not help because I did not send in my Social Security card which violates my consumer rights. So Im Making a formal CFPB complaint that you will correct Equifaxs actions. Below Ive written what is also included in the files uploaded, my disputes for inaccuracies on my credit report.""")
