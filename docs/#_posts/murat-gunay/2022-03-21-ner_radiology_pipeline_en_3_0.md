## How to use






<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">
{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}

```python
from sparknlp.pretrained import PretrainedPipeline

pipeline = PretrainedPipeline("ner_radiology_pipeline", "en", "clinical/models")

pipeline.fullAnnotate("Breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the left shoulder. This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow. This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma.")
```
```scala
import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.pretrained.PretrainedPipeline

val pipeline = new PretrainedPipeline("ner_radiology_pipeline", "en", "clinical/models")

pipeline.fullAnnotate("Breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the left shoulder. This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow. This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma.")
