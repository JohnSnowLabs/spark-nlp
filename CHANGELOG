========
1.4.0
========
---------------
New features
---------------
* All annotator external sources have been unified through an ExternalResource component.
This is used to represents external data information deals with content in HDFS or local just as spark deals with data.
It also improves performance globally and allows customization
into how these sources are read (e.g. as RDD or Line by Line sequences)
* NorvigSweeting SpellChecker, ViveknSentiment and POS Perceptron can now train from the dataset passed to fit().
For Spell Checker, this will be applied if the user did not supply a corpus, forcing fit() to learn from words in the data column.
For ViveknSentiment and POS Perceptron, this strategy will be applied if sentimentCol and posCol params have been set respectively.

---------------
Enhancements
---------------
* ResourceHelper now has an improved SourceStream class which allows for more consistent HDFS/Filesystem reading by using
more of the Hadoop APIs.
* application.conf is now a global setting and can be overridden in run-time through ConfigLoader.setConfigPath(). It may also be accessed from PySpark
* PySpark API improved by creating AnnotatorApproach and AnnotatorModel  classes
* EntityMatcher now uses recursive Pipelines
* Part-of-Speech tagging performance has been improved throughout the prediction algorithm
* EntityMatcher may now use RecursivePipeline in order to tokenize external data with the same pipeline provided by the user

---------------
Developer API
---------------
*PySpark API has been severly improved to make it easier to extend JVM classes
*PySpark API improved for extending annotator approaches and models appropriately

----------------
Bugfixes
----------------
* Reverted a bug introduced causing NER not to read datasets properly from HDFS
* Fixed EntityMatcher wrongly normalizing external content (thanks @sofianeh)

----------------
Documentation
----------------
* Fixed EntityMatcher documentation obsolete params (Thanks @sofianeh)
* Fixed NER CRF documentation in website

========
1.3.0
========
IMPORTANT: Pipelines from 1.2.6 or older cannot be loaded from 1.3.0
---------------
New features
---------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/94
Tokenizer annotator has been revamped. It now follows standard NLP Rules, matching above 90% of StanfordNLP Tokens
This annotator has now more complex rules allowing setting custom composite words as exceptions (e.g. to not break New York)
and custom Prefix, Infix, Suffix and Breaking rules. It uses regular expression groups in order to match various tokens per target word
Defaults have been updated to also be language agnostic and support foreign characters from Unicode charset
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/93
Assertion Status. This annotator identifies negated sequences within target scope. Assertion status is a machine learning
annotator and works throughout a set of Word Embeddings which a set of them is provided as a part of our Python notebook examples.
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/90
Recursive Pipelines. We have created our own Pipeline class which will take more advantages from Spark-NLP annotators.
Although this Pipeline is completely optional and works well with default Apache Spark estimators and transforms, it allows
training our annotators more efficiently by allowing annotator approaches access the previous state of the Pipeline,
allowing them to use it to tokenize or transform their own external content. It is recommended to use such Pipelines.

----------------
Enhancements
----------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/83
Part of Speech training has been improved in both performance and quality, and now better makes use of the input corpus provided.
New params have been extended in order to have more control of its training, through corpusFormat and corpusLimit, allowing
whether to read training data as Dataset or raw text files, and the number of limit files if a folder is provided
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/84
Thanks to @lambdaofgod to allow Normalizer to optionally lower case tokens
* Thanks to Lorenz Bernauer, Normalizer default pattern now becomes language agnostic by not breaking unicode characters such as Spanish or German letters
* Features now have appropriate default values which are lazy by nature and executed only once upon request. This improves by side effect to the Lemmatizer performance.
* RuleFactory (A regex rule factory) performance has been improved due to set to use a Factory pattern and not re-check it's strategy on every transformation in run-time.
This might have positive side effects in SentenceDetector, DateMatcher and RegexMatcher which extensively use this class.

----------------
Class Renames
----------------
RegexTokenizer -> Tokenizer (it is not just regex anymore)
SentenceDetectorModel -> SentenceDetector (it is not a model, it is a rule-based algorithm)
SentimentDetectorModel -> SentimentDetector (it is not a model, it is a rule-based algorithm)

----------------
User Utilities
----------------
* ResourceHelper has a function createDatasetFromText which allows the user to more
easily read one or multiple text files from path into a dataset with various options,
including filename by row or by file aggregation. This class should be more widely
used since it helps dealing with local files parsing. It shall be better documented.
* com.johnsnowlabs.util now contains a Benchmark class which allows measuring the time of
any function easily, by using it as Benchmark.time("Description of measured") {someFunction()}

----------------
Developer API
----------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/89/files
Word embedding traits have been generalized. Now any annotator who might want to use them can easily access their properties
* Recursive pipelines now allow injecting PipelineModel object into train() stage. It is an optional parameter. If the user
utilizes RecursivePipeline, the annotator might use this pipeline for transforming secondary data inputs.
* Annotator abstract class has been divided into a previous RawAnnotator class which contains all annotator properties
and validations, but does not make use of the annotate() function. This allows annotators that need to work directly with
the transform() call, but also participate between other annotators in the pipeline

----------------
Bugfixes
----------------
* Fixed a bug in annotators with word embeddings not correctly serializing into disk
* Fixed a bug creating temporary folders in home folder
* Fixed a broken geospatial pattern in sentence detection

========
1.2.6
========
---------------
Enhancements
---------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/82
Vivekn Sentiment Analysis improved memory consumption and training performance
Parameter pruneCorpus is an adjustable value now, defaults to 1. Higher values lead to better performance
but are meant on larger corpora. tokenPattern params are meant to allow different tokenization regex
within the corpora provided on Vivekn and Norvig models.
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/81
Serialization improvements. New default format (parquet lasted little) is RDD objects. Proved to be lighter on
heap memory. Also added lazier default values for Feature containers. New application.conf performance tunning
settings allow to customize whether we want to Feature broadcast or not, and use parquet or objects in serialization.

========
1.2.5
========
IMPORTANT: Pipelines from 1.2.4 or older cannot be loaded from 1.2.5
---------------
New features
---------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/70
Word embeddings parameter for CRF NER annotator
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/78
Annotator features replace params and are now serialized using KRYO and partitioned files, increases performance and smaller
memory consumption in Driver for saving and loading pipelines with large corpora. Such features are now also broadcasted
for better performance in distributed environments. This enhancement is a breaking change, does not allow to load older pipelines

----------------
Bug fixes
----------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/commit/cb9aa4366f3e2c9863482df39e07b7bacff13049

---------------
New features
---------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/commit/c17ddac7a5a9e775cddc18d672e80e60f0040e38
ResourceHelper now allows input files to be read in the shape of Spark Dataset, implicitly enabling HDFS paths, allowing larger annotator input files. Needs to set 'TXTDS' as input format Param to let annotators read this way. Allowed in: Lemmatizer, EntityExtractor, RegexMatcher, Sentiment Analysis models, Spell Checker and Dependency Parser.

---------------
Enhancements and progress
---------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/commit/4920e5ce394b25937969cc4cab1d81172be722a3
