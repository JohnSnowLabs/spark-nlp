1.8.2
========
---------------
Overview
---------------
This release potentially targets to improve performance and resource usage in some pipelines that use word embeddings, it also comes
together with a very interesting autorotation feature in OCR, and a couple of new annotators to solve particular needs, including the ChunkTokenizer
or a Param to limit sentence lengths. Finally, we are starting to organize our multilingual store of models and data for training models.
Check the examples for some italian notebooks!. Thanks again to all community for such quick feedback all the time.

---------------
New Features
---------------
* OCR now capable of automatic rotation, significantly improving accuracy in some scenarios
* ChunkTokenizer is a new annotator that Tokenizes CHUNK type annotations. Extends Tokenizer algorithm and stores chunk ID for reference.
* SentenceDetector new Param maxLength now cuts off sentences longer than (by default) 240 characters. It avoids Deep Learning annotator issues and may improve performance in some scenarios.
* NerConverter new Param whiteList now allows a list of NER labels to be considered, while discarding the rest. May be useful for selective CHUNKing pipelines.

---------------
Enhancements
---------------
* Pipelines using Word Embeddings should now perform faster due to a group of RocksDB optimizations allowing annotators to reuse current open connections to DB

---------------
Bugfixes
---------------
* Fixed a bug where DeepSentenceDetector was missing the load() interface (Thanks @Tshimanga from Deep6!)
* Fixed a bug where RocksDB opened too many files at once causing pipelines to fail or to work very slowly

========
1.6.3
========
---------------
Overview
---------------
This release includes a new annotator for de-identification of sensitive information. It uses CHUNK annotations, meaning its accuracy will depend on previous annotators on the pipeline.
Also, OCR capabilities have been improved in the OCR module.
In terms of broken stuff, we've fixed a few annoying bugs on SymmetricDelete and SentenceDetector explode feature.
Finally, pip is now part of the official repositories, meaning you can install it just as any other module. It also includes jars and we've added a SparkNLP class which creates SparkSession easily for you.
Thanks again for all community contribution in issues, feedback and comments in GitHub and in Slack.

---------------
New features
---------------
* DeIdentification annotator, takes DOCUMENT and TOKEN from the original sentence, plus a CHUNK annotation to anonymize target chunk in sentence. CHUNK annotation might come from NerConverter, TextMatcher or other chunk annotators.

1.6.2
========
---------------
Overview
---------------
In this release, we focused on reviewing out streaming performance, buy measuring our amount of sentences processed by second, through a LightPipeline.
We increased Norvig Spell Checker by more than 300% by disabling DoubleVariants and improving algorithm orders. It is now reported capable of 42K sentences per second.
Symmetric Delete Spell checker is more performance, although it has been reported to process 2K sentences per second.
NerCRF has been reported to process 300 hundred sentences per second, while NerDL can do twice fast (about 700 sentences per second).
Vivekn Sentiment Analysis was improved and is now capable to processing 100K sentences per sentence (before it was below 500).
Finally, SentenceDetector performance was improved by a 40% from ~30K rows processed per second to ~40K. But, we have now enabled Abbreviation processing by default which reduces final speed to 22K rows per second with a negative net but better accuracy.
Again, thanks for the community for helping with feedback. We welcome everyone asking questions or giving feedback in our Slack channel or reporting issues on Github.

---------------
Enhancements
---------------
* OCR now features kernel segmentation. Significantly improves image based PDF processing
* Vivekn Sentiment Analysis prediction performance improved by better data structures
* Both Norvig and Symmetric Delete spell checkers now have improved performance

* Tensorflow sessions now all support allow_soft_placement, supporting GPU based graphs to work with and without GPU
* Norvig Spell Checker fixed a missing step from the algorithm to check for additional variants. May improve accuracy
* Norvig Spell Checker disabled DoubleVariants by default. Was not improving accuracy significantly and was hitting performance very hard

---------------
Developer API
---------------
* New FeatureSet allows HashSet params

---------------
Models
---------------
* Vivekn Sentiment Pipeline doesn't have Spell Checker anymore
* Fixed Vivekn Sentiment pretrained improved accuracy

========
1.6.1
========
---------------
Overview
---------------
Hi! We're glad to announce new hotfix 1.6.1. Although changes seem modest or very specific, there is a lot going underground. First of all, we've worked hard with the community to understand S3-based clusters,
which don't have a common fs.defaultFS configuration, which is the one we use to tell where is the cluster temp folder located in order to distribute word embeddings. We fixed two things here,
on one side we fixed a bug pointing to the wrong filesystem. Second, we added a custom override setting in application.conf that allows manually setting where to put temp folders in cluster. This should help S3 users.
Please share your feedback on this regard.
On the other hand, we created a new annotator type internally. The CHUNK type allows better modulary in the communication between different annotators. Impact will be noticed implicitly and over time.

---------------
New features
---------------
* new Scala-only functions that make it easier to work with Annotations in Dataframes. May be imported through com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.functions._ and allow mapping and filtering within and outside Annotations.
filterByAnnotations, mapAnnotations and explodeAnnotations work by providing a column and a function. Check out documentation. Possibly later coming to Python.

---------------
Bug fixes
---------------
* Fixed incorrect filesystem readings in some S3 environments for word embeddings
* Fixed NerCRF not correctly training from CONLL, labeling everything as -O- (Thanks @arnound from Slack Channel)

---------------
Enhancements
---------------
* Added overrideable config sparknlp.settings.cluster_tmp_dir allows setting cluster location for temporary embeddings file. May help S3 based clusters with no fs.defaultFS set to a proper distributed storage.
* New annotator type: CHUNK. Representes a SUBSTRING of DOCUMENT and it is used as output from NerConverter, TextMatcher, RegexMatcher and other annotators that retrieve a substring from the original document.
This will make for better modularity and integration within various annotators, such as between NER and AssertionStatus.
* New annotation transformer: ChunkAssembler. Takes a string or array(string) column from a dataset and creates a CHUNK type annotator. The content must also belong to the current DOCUMENT annotation's content.
* SentenceDetector new param explodeSentences allow to explode sentences within a single row into different rows to increase parallelism and performance in some scenarios. Particularly OCR based.
* AssertionDLApproach now may be used within LightPipelines
* AssertionDLApproach and AssertionLogRegApproach now work from CHUNK type instead of start/end bounds. May still be trained with Start/end though. This means target for assertion may be any CHUNK output annotator now (e.g. RegexMatcher)

---------------
Other
---------------
* PerceptronApproachLegacy moved back to default PerceptronApproach. Distributed PerceptronApproach moved to PerceptronApproachDistributed due to not meeting accuracy expectations yet.
* Some configuration parameters in application.conf have been appropriately moved to proper annotator Params (NorvigSweeting Spell Checker, Vivekn Approach and Sentiment Detector affected)
* application.conf renamed configuration values for better consistency

---------------
Developer API
---------------
* Added beforeAnnotate() and afterAnnotate() to manipulate dataframes after or before calling annotate() UDF
* Added extraValidate() and extraValidateMsg() in all annotators to provide developer to add additional SCHEMA checks in transformSchema() stage
* Removed validation() stage in fit() stage. Allows for more flexible training when some of the columns are not really required yet.
* WrapColumnMetadata() will wrap an Annotation column with its appropriate Metadata. Makes it easier not to forget about Metadata in Schema.
* RawAnnotator trait has now all the basics needed to start a new Annotator without annotate() function. It is a complete previous stage before AnnotatorModel, which inherits from RawAnnotator.

========
1.6.0
========
---------------
Overview
---------------
We're late! But it was worth it. We're glad to release 1.6.0 which brings new features, lots of enhancements and many bugfixes. First of all, we are thankful for community participating in Slack and in GitHub by reporting feedback and issues.
In this one, we have a new annotator, the Chunker, which allows to grab pieces of text following a particular Part-of-Speech pattern.
On the other hand, we have a brand new OCR to Spark Dataframe utility, which bundles as an optional component to Spark-NLP. This one requires tesseract 4.x+ to be installed on your system, and may be downloaded from our website or readme pages.
Aside from that, we improved in many areas, from the DocumentAssembler to work better with OCR output, down to our Deep Learning models with better consistency and accuracy. Word Embedding based annotators also receive improvements when working in Cluster environments.
Finally, we are glad a user contributed a fix to the AWS dependency issue, particularly happening in Cloudera environments. We're still waiting for feedback, and gladly accept it.
We'll be working on the documentation as this release follows. Thank you.

---------------
New Features
---------------
* New annotator: Chunker. This annotator takes regex for Part-of-Speech tags and returns appropriate chunks of text following such patterns
* OCR to Spark-NLP: As an optional jar module, users may use OcrHelper class in order to convert PDF files into Spark Dataset, ready to be utilized by Spark-NLP's document assembler. May be used without Spark-NLP. Requires Tesseract 4.x on your system.

---------------
Enhancements
---------------
* TextMatcher now has caseSensitive (setCaseSensitive) Param which allows to setup for matching with case sensitivity or not (Ignores if Normalizer did it). Returned word is still the original.
* LightPipelines in Python should now be faster thanks to an optimization of prefetching results into Python memory instead of py4j bridge
* LightPipelines can now handle embedded Pipelines
* PerceptronApproach now trains utilizing full Spark distributed algoritm. Still experimental. PerceptronApproachLegacy may still be used, which might be better for local non cluster setups.
* Tokenizer now has a param 'includeDefaults' which may be set to False to disable all preset-rules.
* WordEmbedding based annotators may now decide to normalize tokens before matching embeddings vectors through 'useNormalizedTokensForEmbeddings' Param. Generally improves consistency, lesser overfitting.
* DocumentAssembler may now better deal with large amounts of texts by using 'trimAndClearNewLines' to better work with OCR Outputs and be better ready for further Sentence Detection
* Improved SentenceDetector handling of enumerations and lists
* Slightly improved SentenceDetector performance through non-tail-recursive optimizations
* Finisher does no longer have default delimiters when output into String (not Array) (thanks @S_L)

---------------
Bug fixes
---------------
* AWS library dependecy conflict now resolved (Thanks to @apiltamang for proposing solution. thanks to the community for follow-up). Solution is experimental, waiting for feedback.
* Fixed wrong order of further added Tokenizer's infixPatterns in Python (Thanks @sethah)
* Training annotators that use Word Embeddings in a distributed cluster does no longer throw file not found exceptions sporadically
* Fixed NerDLModel returning non-deterministic results during prediction
* Deep-Learning based models and graphs now allow running them on CPU if trained on GPU and GPU is not available on client
* WordEmbeddings temporary location no longer in HOME dir, moved to tmp.dir
* Fixed SentenceDetector incorrectly bounding sentences with non-English characters (Thanks @lorenz-nlp)
* Python Spark-NLP annotator models should now have all appropriate setter and getter functions for Params
* Fixed wrong-format of column when showing Metadata through Finisher's output as Array
* Added missing python Finisher's include metadata function (thanks @PinusSilvestris for reporting the bug)
* Fixed Symmetric Delete Spell Checker throwing wrong error when training with an empty dataset (Thanks @ankush)

---------------
Developer API
---------------
* Deep Learning models may now be read through SavedModelBundle API into Tensorflow for Java in TensorflowWrapper
* WordEmbeddings now allow checking if word exists with contains()
* Included tool that converts text into CoNLL format for further labeling for training NER models (

========
1.5.4
========
---------------
Overview
---------------
This release improves various annotators: the Normalizer, SymmetricDelete, TextMatcher, DocumentAssembler and Finisher
allowing them to cover more use-cases that were mentioned in our Slack channel. We also fixed two important bugs.
Finally, this will be our first release with PIP support for python sparknlp, for those entirely python based.

---------------
Enhancements
---------------
* Normalizer now allows multiple to-delete regex patterns.
* Normalizer slangDictionary param allows converting tokens into something else (e.g. 'lol' into 'laughing out loud') from a dictionary file
* SymmetricDelete spell checker may now be trained from the dataset passed to fit if external corpus not provided
* SymmetricDelete spell checker improved training and prediction performance
* Finisher param includeMetadata now outputs annotation metadata content both in Array format or String format

========
1.5.2
========
---------------
Overview
---------------
This release focuses on improving model downloader stability, fixing word embedding reading issues and joining
spark ecosystem filesystem configuration appropriately, utilizing spark's defined default filesystem, in order to work
properly with clusters and multi node environments. This includes Databricks cloud clusters or Amazon EMR yarn HDFS nodes.

Aside of that we come up with exciting new features, a brand new Spell Checker with higher accuracy inspired on the
Symmetric delete algorithm.

Finally Assertion Status can be trained and predicted on top of NER output, since before
this only worked by providing assertion status Start and End boundaries for the target to assert.

---------------

* Model and Pipeline Downloader
We are glad to announce our first experimental model downloader, working both in Python and Scala.
This allows to download pre-trained models from our public storage. This does not include any pre-trained models yet
but just the logic to be able to do it.

---------------
Enhancements
---------------
* Improved ExternalResource API (introduced in 1.4.0) to make it easier to provide external corpus and resource information
on annotators such as readAs (which allows setting how would you like SparkNLP to read your source), delimiters and parse settings among
other options that might be passed to Spark Reader directly. Annotators using external sources now all share this functionality.
WordEmbeddings are not yet supported on this format.
* All python annotators now properly have getter functions to retrieve param values

It also improves performance globally and allows customization
into how these sources are read (e.g. as RDD or Line by Line sequences)
* NorvigSweeting SpellChecker, ViveknSentiment and POS Perceptron can now train from the dataset passed to fit().
For Spell Checker, this will be applied if the user did not supply a corpus, forcing fit() to learn from words in the data column.
For ViveknSentiment and POS Perceptron, this strategy will be applied if sentimentCol and posCol params have been set respectively.

---------------
Enhancements
---------------
* ResourceHelper now has an improved SourceStream class which allows for more consistent HDFS/Filesystem reading by using
more of the Hadoop APIs.
* application.conf is now a global setting and can be overridden in run-time through ConfigLoader.setConfigPath(). It may also be accessed from PySpark
* PySpark API improved by creating AnnotatorApproach and AnnotatorModel  classes
* EntityMatcher now uses recursive Pipelines
* Part-of-Speech tagging performance has been improved throughout the prediction algorithm
* EntityMatcher may now use RecursivePipeline in order to tokenize external data with the same pipeline provided by the user

---------------
Developer API
---------------

========
1.3.0
========
IMPORTANT: Pipelines from 1.2.6 or older cannot be loaded from 1.3.0
---------------
New features
---------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/94
Tokenizer annotator has been revamped. It now follows standard NLP Rules, matching above 90% of StanfordNLP Tokens
This annotator has now more complex rules allowing setting custom composite words as exceptions (e.g. to not break New York)
and custom Prefix, Infix, Suffix and Breaking rules. It uses regular expression groups in order to match various tokens per target word
Defaults have been updated to also be language agnostic and support foreign characters from Unicode charset
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/93
Assertion Status. This annotator identifies negated sequences within target scope. Assertion status is a machine learning
annotator and works throughout a set of Word Embeddings which a set of them is provided as a part of our Python notebook examples.
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/90
Recursive Pipelines. We have created our own Pipeline class which will take more advantages from Spark-NLP annotators.
Although this Pipeline is completely optional and works well with default Apache Spark estimators and transforms, it allows
training our annotators more efficiently by allowing annotator approaches access the previous state of the Pipeline,
allowing them to use it to tokenize or transform their own external content. It is recommended to use such Pipelines.

----------------
Enhancements
----------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/83
Part of Speech training has been improved in both performance and quality, and now better makes use of the input corpus provided.
New params have been extended in order to have more control of its training, through corpusFormat and corpusLimit, allowing
whether to read training data as Dataset or raw text files, and the number of limit files if a folder is provided
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/84
Thanks to @lambdaofgod to allow Normalizer to optionally lower case tokens
* Thanks to Lorenz Bernauer, Normalizer default pattern now becomes language agnostic by not breaking unicode characters such as Spanish or German letters
* Features now have appropriate default values which are lazy by nature and executed only once upon request. This improves by side effect to the Lemmatizer performance.
* RuleFactory (A regex rule factory) performance has been improved due to set to use a Factory pattern and not re-check it's strategy on every transformation in run-time.
This might have positive side effects in SentenceDetector, DateMatcher and RegexMatcher which extensively use this class.

----------------
Class Renames
----------------
RegexTokenizer -> Tokenizer (it is not just regex anymore)
SentenceDetectorModel -> SentenceDetector (it is not a model, it is a rule-based algorithm)
SentimentDetectorModel -> SentimentDetector (it is not a model, it is a rule-based algorithm)

----------------
User Utilities
----------------
* ResourceHelper has a function createDatasetFromText which allows the user to more
easily read one or multiple text files from path into a dataset with various options,
including filename by row or by file aggregation. This class should be more widely
used since it helps dealing with local files parsing. It shall be better documented.
* com.johnsnowlabs.util now contains a Benchmark class which allows measuring the time of
any function easily, by using it as Benchmark.time("Description of measured") {someFunction()}

----------------
Developer API
----------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/89/files
Word embedding traits have been generalized. Now any annotator who might want to use them can easily access their properties
* Recursive pipelines now allow injecting PipelineModel object into train() stage. It is an optional parameter. If the user
utilizes RecursivePipeline, the annotator might use this pipeline for transforming secondary data inputs.
* Annotator abstract class has been divided into a previous RawAnnotator class which contains all annotator properties
and validations, but does not make use of the annotate() function. This allows annotators that need to work directly with
the transform() call, but also participate between other annotators in the pipeline

----------------
Bugfixes
----------------
* Fixed a bug in annotators with word embeddings not correctly serializing into disk
* Fixed a bug creating temporary folders in home folder
* Fixed a broken geospatial pattern in sentence detection

========
1.2.6
========
---------------
Enhancements
---------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/82
Vivekn Sentiment Analysis improved memory consumption and training performance
Parameter pruneCorpus is an adjustable value now, defaults to 1. Higher values lead to better performance
but are meant on larger corpora. tokenPattern params are meant to allow different tokenization regex
within the corpora provided on Vivekn and Norvig models.
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/81
Serialization improvements. New default format (parquet lasted little) is RDD objects. Proved to be lighter on
heap memory. Also added lazier default values for Feature containers. New application.conf performance tunning
settings allow to customize whether we want to Feature broadcast or not, and use parquet or objects in serialization.

========
1.2.5
========
IMPORTANT: Pipelines from 1.2.4 or older cannot be loaded from 1.2.5
---------------
New features
---------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/70
Word embeddings parameter for CRF NER annotator
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/78
Annotator features replace params and are now serialized using KRYO and partitioned files, increases performance and smaller
memory consumption in Driver for saving and loading pipelines with large corpora. Such features are now also broadcasted
for better performance in distributed environments. This enhancement is a breaking change, does not allow to load older pipelines

----------------
Bug fixes
----------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/commit/cb9aa4366f3e2c9863482df39e07b7bacff13049

New features
---------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/commit/c17ddac7a5a9e775cddc18d672e80e60f0040e38
ResourceHelper now allows input files to be read in the shape of Spark Dataset, implicitly enabling HDFS paths, allowing larger annotator input files. Needs to set 'TXTDS' as input format Param to let annotators read this way. Allowed in: Lemmatizer, EntityExtractor, RegexMatcher, Sentiment Analysis models, Spell Checker and Dependency Parser.
