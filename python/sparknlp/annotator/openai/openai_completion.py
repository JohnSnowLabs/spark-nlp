   Parameters
   ----------
   model
       ID of the OpenAI model to use
   suffix
        The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text
   maxTokens
        The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion.
   temperature
        What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2
   topP
        An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass
   numberOfCompletions
        How many completions to generate for each prompt.
   logprobs
        Include the log probabilities on the logprobs most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens.
   echo
       Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion
   stop
      Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.
   presencePenalty
      Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
   frequencyPenalty
      Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
   bestOf
      Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the `best` (the one with the highest log probability per token).
   logitBias
      Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.
   user
      A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse.
