class YakeKeywordExtraction(AnnotatorModel):
    """Yake is an Unsupervised, Corpus-Independent, Domain and
    Language-Independent and Single-Document keyword extraction algorithm.

    Extracting keywords from texts has become a challenge for individuals and
    organizations as the information grows in complexity and size. The need to
    automate this task so that text can be processed in a timely and adequate
    manner has led to the emergence of automatic keyword extraction tools. Yake
    is a novel feature-based system for multi-lingual keyword extraction, which
    supports texts of different sizes, domain or languages. Unlike other
    approaches, Yake does not rely on dictionaries nor thesauri, neither is
    trained against any corpora. Instead, it follows an unsupervised approach
    which builds upon features extracted from the text, making it thus
    applicable to documents written in different languages without the need for
    further knowledge. This can be beneficial for a large number of tasks and a
    plethora of situations where access to training corpora is either limited or
    restricted. The algorithm makes use of the position of a sentence and token.
    Therefore, to use the annotator, the text should be first sent through a
    Sentence Boundary Detector and then a tokenizer.

    See the parameters section for tweakable parameters to get the best result
    from the annotator.

    Note that each keyword will be given a keyword score greater than 0 (The
    lower the score better the keyword). Therefore to filter the keywords, an
    upper bound for the score can be set with :meth:`.setThreshold`.

    For extended examples of usage, see the `Spark NLP Workshop
    <https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Public/8.Keyword_Extraction_YAKE.ipynb>`__.

    **Paper abstract:**

    *As the amount of generated information grows, reading and summarizing texts
    of large collections turns into a challenging task. Many documents do not
    come with descriptive terms, thus requiring humans to generate keywords
    on-the-fly. The need to automate this kind of task demands the development
    of keyword extraction systems with the ability to automatically identify
    keywords within the text. One approach is to resort to machine-learning
    algorithms. These, however, depend on large annotated text corpora, which
    are not always available. An alternative solution is to consider an
    unsupervised approach. In this article, we describe YAKE!, a light-weight
    unsupervised automatic keyword extraction method which rests on statistical
    text features extracted from single documents to select the most relevant
    keywords of a text. Our system does not need to be trained on a particular
    set of documents, nor does it depend on dictionaries, external corpora, text
    size, language, or domain. To demonstrate the merits and significance of
    YAKE!, we compare it against ten state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches
    and one supervised method. Experimental results carried out on top of twenty
    datasets show that YAKE! significantly outperforms other unsupervised
    methods on texts of different sizes, languages, and domains.*

    ...     "Sources tell us that Google is acquiring Kaggle, a platform that hosts data science and machine learning competitions. Details about the transaction remain somewhat vague, but given that Google is hosting its Cloud Next conference in San Francisco this week, the official announcement could come as early as tomorrow. Reached by phone, Kaggle co-founder CEO Anthony Goldbloom declined to deny that the acquisition is happening. Google itself declined 'to comment on rumors'. Kaggle, which has about half a million data scientists on its platform, was founded by Goldbloom  and Ben Hamner in 2010. The service got an early start and even though it has a few competitors like DrivenData, TopCoder and HackerRank, it has managed to stay well ahead of them by focusing on its specific niche. The service is basically the de facto home for running data science and machine learning competitions. With Kaggle, Google is buying one of the largest and most active communities for data scientists - and with that, it will get increased mindshare in this community, too (though it already has plenty of that thanks to Tensorflow and other projects). Kaggle has a bit of a history with Google, too, but that's pretty recent. Earlier this month, Google and Kaggle teamed up to host a $100,000 machine learning competition around classifying YouTube videos. That competition had some deep integrations with the Google Cloud Platform, too. Our understanding is that Google will keep the service running - likely under its current name. While the acquisition is probably more about Kaggle's community than technology, Kaggle did build some interesting tools for hosting its competition and 'kernels', too. On Kaggle, kernels are basically the source code for analyzing data sets and developers can share this code on the platform (the company previously called them 'scripts'). Like similar competition-centric sites, Kaggle also runs a job board, too. It's unclear what Google will do with that part of the service. According to Crunchbase, Kaggle raised $12.5 million (though PitchBook says it's $12.75) since its   launch in 2010. Investors in Kaggle include Index Ventures, SV Angel, Max Levchin, NaRavikant, Google chie economist Hal Varian, Khosla Ventures and Yuri Milner"
