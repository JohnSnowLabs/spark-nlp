MLflow - a platform for the machine learning lifecycle
######################################################


Spark NLP uses Spark MLlib Pipelines, what are natively supported by MLFlow.
MLFlow is, as stated in their [official webpage](https://mlflow.org/), an open
source platform for the machine learning lifecycle, that includes:
* **Mlflow Tracking**: Record and query experiments: code, data, config, and
results
* **MLflow Projects**: Package data science code in a format to reproduce runs
on any platform
* **MLflow Models**: Deploy machine learning models in diverse serving
environments
* **Model Registry**: Store, annotate, discover, and manage models in a central
repository

For more information, please see the complete guide at
`Experiment Tracking </docs/en/mlflow>`__.
